1,Why is Hong Kong’s Sovereignty So Important to China?,How a Complex Geopolitical Calculus Informs Beijing's Decisions,/index.html,Noah Caldwell-Gatsos,mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,8/7/19,12:00PM CST,/projects/geo/images/bp1front.jpg,View of the Hong Kong Skyline,Google Images,"Hong Kong represents more than a powerful economic hub for the People’s Republic of China. It’s recent protests are more than just a demand for return to the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ policy. The matter of Hong Kong is of paramount importance to Chinese leaders because of optics. If Beijing allows Hong Kong to resume its sovereignty and right to self governance, they risk allowing the same sentiments to begin growing in other regions unhappy with China’s leadership and aims. ","Despite the immense Han majority in Eastern, Costal China - the Republic’s greater territory is a patchwork of unassociated ethnic groups and socio-cultural beliefs that share little in common with Beijing’s collectivist approach. This is not unique to China - American territories, European colonies, the British Raj, the Japanese Empire’s conquered land, and Soviet satellites possessed many of the same qualities and dissonances. Subjugated locals were (and rightfully so) unhappy with far-away capitals determining their rights and governance. If Beijing allows Hong Kong to gain greater autonomy, they risk giving the green light for Taiwan, Tibet, Macau, Xinjiang, and even some of the central provinces to do the same. Beijing consistently places emphasis on stability and interconnectedness above all other qualities in their rhetoric. The stamp on dissent when it appears, for if it festers, it make provoke a backlash they can’t control. ","This has happened to Beijing several times in China’s recent history. Unlike the United States, Beijing has historically asserted its continent-wide dominance over highly populated communities with long, rich histories. The United States may be the only continent-sized nation that did not have to compensate for its size by accommodating the various mini-nations that lived under its banner. Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Manchuria, and the Coastal Cities all have historically differing interests than a support for a common China. The government in Beijing has fractured at several points throughout history, often when one of the fringe states is empowered by a weak capital, supported by a foreign nation that they share greater ties with, and the Costal Regions are apathetic. Therefore it is no surprise that modern China prioritizes national unity over all other qualities (and might provide one insight why the one-party, authoritarian model is so appealing to Chinese power brokers).","The stakes are about the same for Greater China as they were for the Soviet Union. Like China, the Soviet Union desperately needed the fringe regions for their own geopolitical security. Xinjiang and Tibet are essential parts of China not because they’re economic boons (though they do both possess some important mineral resources), but because they allow China a buffer between themselves and potentially hostile rivals like India or the Russians. Despite cultural dissimilarities between the ethnic groups that populate the two fringe regions and the Han Chinese that control power in Greater China’s political and economic centers, they are on the inner side of natural boundaries that grant the Chinese an ideal strategic position. The Himalayas and the Karakorum Range running through Tibet and Xinjiang are high ground, versus the relatively flat lands that connect the pair of provinces with central China. If the Russians, Turks, or Arabs were to gain a foothold in Xinjiang, they could easily have a garrison to use as leverage against China. Likewise, if Tibet became a client state of the Indians (likely, as Tibet’s relatively unpopulated and has little economic potential), they could just as easily use it to garrison their own troops to use as leverage. Would either group really be a threat to China’s 1-million strong PLA? No. Would it be enough of a nuisance to factor into strategic planning? Without a doubt. ","Like the Domino Theory that caught fire among Western strategists during the Cold War, Beijing views the revolutionary protests of one fringe as a potential spark which could become a wildfire that enflames the rest of the country. Backing off of Hong Kong (or Taiwan for that matter) would signal to activists and protestors in the fringe regions that if they put up a significant fight they could have leverage against Beijing. The Chinese government cannot tolerate this.

2,ISRAEL - A Short Explainer on U.S.-Israel Relations in 2019, Why is it Notable That the Israelis Just Banned Two Members of Congress?, /index.html, Noah Caldwell-Gatsos, mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com, @ Noah, 8/15/19, 12:22PM CST, /projects/geo/images/bp2front.jpg," Reps Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, the first Muslim women elected to congress.", Google Images," Rep. Ilhan Omar (Democrat-MN05) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (Democrat-MI13) have both just been banned from entering Israel. This decision comes just a month after the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer, announced that both lawmakers would be allowed to visit, and two days after President Trump wrote a tweet about it. Here‚Äôs a short explainer on recent events between the U.S. and Israel. "," <b>Why Are They Banned?</b> Rep. Omar and Rep. Tlaib are the second Muslim members of Congress in U.S. history after Omar‚Äôs predecessor, Rep. Keith Ellison. Both have publicly supported the ‚ÄúBoycott Israel Movement‚Äù that calls for a rejection of Israeli products, divestment from American loans and transfers of technology, and sanctions if the Israelis do not withdraw from Palestine. Rep. Tlaib‚Äôs family is from Palestine. The BDS Movement has widely been condemned through the international community, though it has attracted supporters like the ACLU and liberal Jewish think tank J-Street. Israel has banned all public supporters of the BDS Movement from entering the country, but U.S. Members of Congress are an extremely unique case. "," <b>Why is Banning U.S. Members of Congress Extreme?</b> It is a very risky move for Prime Minister Netanyahu‚Äôs government. Despite the goodwill he might have generated from the President, it is the U.S. House of Representatives that approves the billions of dollars given to Israel every year. Taking the unusual step of banning members of Congress risks undermining the bipartisan support that Israel has enjoyed for decades - especially as the Democratic Party controls the House. It is also a question of optics - allowing members of a foreign government access to your country demonstrates that you view them as an ally. Taking away that privilege risks irreparably damaging the relationship, and shifting the paradigm of American voters viewing Israel as an ally. Many U.S. Democratic Candidates for President have already denounced the move alongside prominent U.S. committee chairs. ","<b>Why Does Netanyahu Do What Trump Says?</b> Much of Netanyahu‚Äôs appeal to the Israeli electorate stems with how they view his handling of Israel‚Äôs most important ally. Israel is one of the only countries in the world that holds a positive approval rating of the Trump Administration. He also had a comparatively frosty relationship with the Obama Administration, which began taking steps to divest American funds from Israeli operations. To be an effective Israeli leader, there are a number of objectives that they must achieve through their interaction with the Americans, and Netanyahu and his advisors must have calculated that their relationship with the President and the Republican Party is more important than their relationship with the increasingly skeptical Democratic Party. Netanyahu has a very tough election coming up in October, and is likely eager to distract attention away from his personal and financial scandals. "," <b>What Do Americans Give to Israel?</b> Besides the symbolic gestures that the Trump Administration has granted to Israel in recent years, like the movement of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, we also give a substantial amount of money, logistical, and military aid and directly facilitate U.S. foreign direct investment into the country. This aid is not remarkably different than similar programs granted to secondary allies outside the Pacific Alliance and NATO like Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. You can see a comprehensive, factual, and declassified overview of U.S. foreign aid to Israel <a href=‚Äúhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf‚Äù>here</a>.", Israel, The Squad, Netanyahu, Trump, https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/15/how-and-how-not-to-talk-about-the-israel-lobby/, How (and How Not) to Talk About the Israel Lobby, https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf, U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel, https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/15/israel-ilhan-omar-rashida-tlaib-netanyahu-1463655," Israel Bars Omar, Tlaib from Entering Country As Trump Lashes Out"," <b>Why is it Difficult to Critique Israel as an American?</b> Israel is a paradoxical ally. It is the only stable democracy in the Middle East and has many cultural similarities with the U.S. It provides us with vital intelligence in a hostile region and grants logistical support to our troops. At the same time, it often deliberately undermines U.S. influence and interests by taking geopolitically risky actions it determines to be in the defense of their country, like physically attacking Iran-backed groups in Lebanon and Syria, launching cyberattacks against Iran and other nations, ignoring potential life-threatening consequences to our troops, and committing human rights abuses against the Palestinians within their sphere of control. Whether these actions are morally defensible in the name of national security is a concern for a much, much longer paper, but in this paper‚Äôs window: are these actions worthy of U.S. taxpayer support?"," <b>Is it Politically Unpopular to Critique U.S. Policy on Israel?</b> Americans absolutely can and should have qualms about aspects of the U.S.-Israeli relationship, but any criticisms must be weighed with the history of political action against Jews. There‚Äôs a variety of very widespread misconceptions about the Israeli-U.S. relationship that often possess origins in anti-Semitic tropes. They usually involve money - Rep. Omar was widely condemned for her use of ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about those Benjamins baby‚Äù tweet to imply that it was Jewish-backed money that encouraged positive U.S. policy towards Israel. It is also widely believed that advocacy groups like AIPAC donate money to candidates, which they do not. The American black community in particular has a troubled history with the American Jewish community, with Jewish votes derailing Jesse Jackson‚Äôs presidential/vice presidential bids in 1984, 1988, and 1992 and anti-Semitic views coming from black Muslims throughout the 20th century.", EP3, EP4, EP5, EP6, EP7, EP8, EP9, EP10,
3,HONG KONG - The Mainland‚Äôs Economic Leverage Over the City State, Beijing Has More Powers at Its Disposal Than Military Force, /index.html, Noah Caldwell-Gatsos, mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com, @ Noah, 8/19/19, 5:36PM CST, /projects/geo/images/bp3front.jpg, Sunset in Hong Kong., from: Simon Zhu @ unsplash.com," Shenzhen‚Äôs going through a Manhattanization. In the 60s and 70s, the U.S. transformed Miami from a struggling Florida backwater into a shiny example of successful capitalism through direct investment to contrast themselves with the Soviet Union and Cuba. Beijing appears to have learned the lesson, seeking to have the rapidly growing Southern port city serve as a ‚Äòdemonstration area‚Äô of the benefits of Chinese socialism. All of this effort comes at the expense of Hong Kong‚Äôs status as the premier financial center of Pacific Asia. With their traditional role as the investment conduit into China diminishing, Hong Kong has also found themselves to be economically vulnerable to Beijing. "," Hong Kong is dependent on Mainland China for the majority of its resources. Attempting to sustain a population of 7 million is unmanageable using the tiny areas around the city-state. The region obtains 70% of its water from the East River in Guangdong, a transfer that is heavily subsidized by the Hong Kong government[<a href=‚Äúhttps://www.scmp.com/business/article/1400946/hong-kong-needs-fresh-policy-water-taps-run-dry‚Äù>1</a>]. The Hong Kong electrical grid is interconnected with the mainland‚Äôs Southern Power Grid and it imports nearly a quarter of its energy from this same region [<a href=‚Äúhttps://www.legco.gov.hk/yr10-11/english/panels/se/papers/se0117cb2-767-2-e.pdf‚Äù>2</a>]. Mainland China also provides most, if not nearly all, of Hong Kong‚Äôs food[<a href=‚Äúhttps://www.fhb.gov.hk/download/press_and_publications/otherinfo/110318_food_supply_faq/e_food_supply_faq.pdf‚Äù>3</a>]. Beijing has yet to threaten to restrict energy supplies, but Hong Kong‚Äôs water and energy security has historically been a major issue for the city state in times of political turmoil."," The Chinese Communist Party cannot afford for Hong Kong‚Äôs tensions to affect the rest of the country, as I‚Äôve described <a href=‚Äú/posts/geo_bp1.html‚Äù>here</a>. It remains a major international financial and business center, as well as a special administrative region that enjoys unique relationships with the U.S., the U.K., and other countries. A liberated Hong Kong would be disastrous for the CCP‚Äôs national image. That‚Äôs not to say Beijing will need to use military force to ensure that Hong Kong remains a part of Greater China. Leadership in Beijing has become much subtler than Deng Xiaoping‚Äôs inflammatory policies that dealt a major blow to China‚Äôs international reputation. China‚Äôs economy suffered terribly post-Tiananmen, having loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank rescinded and their entry to the World Trade Organization delayed by a decade and a half. ","Beijing is stuck in a difficult position - the 2019 Protests have no leader, therefore there is no one to negotiate with. Chinese culture would also make it difficult to resolve this dispute, even if there was a central unifying figure - neither side wants to lose face (the CCP cannot afford to look weak). Therefore, Beijing has no real options to de-escalate through diplomacy. However, it possesses one main asset in lieu of direct military oppression: economic leverage. Hong Kong only sends 8% of its total exports to the United States, but has its currency pegged to the U.S. dollar. There are no restrictions to foreign banks in the city, and its entire business culture is enticing to FDIs. This is all allowed by Beijing by keeping Hong Kong as a special administrative region. Despite the shared markets between Hong Kong and the U.S. (and Europe for that matter) are tiny compared to others, having Beijing restrict their ability to  manage capital would be devastating to the Hong Kong economy and their reputation as a financial hub. "," These attempts to strangle Hong Kong economically - through finances and food -  may come back to bite Beijing. 58% of Chinese outbound foreign direct investment flows through the island[<a href=‚Äúhttps://fortune.com/2019/08/19/hong-kong-protests-china-supress/‚Äù>4</a>]. Without Hong Kong, Chairman Xi‚Äôs One Belt, One Road initiative would crumble. Shanghai and Shenzhen cannot serve as China‚Äôs replacement centers anytime soon, capital controls placed by the government prevent money from moving in and out easily. Hong Kong also has numerous financial advantages over the mainland, all revolving around their special administrative status and financial transactions. Neither Shanghai, Beijing, nor Shenzhen possess Hong Kong‚Äôs combination of a registration-based IPO system (stock listings are faster and  easier to accomplish), no capital controls, little international exposure or history, sound financial infrastructure limiting operational costs, transparency, and effective financial regulations [<a href=‚Äúhttps://www.piie.com/blogs/china-economic-watch/why-china-still-needs-hong-kong‚Äù>5</a>].

4,"ITALY - Thanks to Salvini, the EU Won‚Äôt Have to Worry About a Potential Italian Departure for a While", Euroskeptic Far-Right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini just played a very good hand extremely badly. The Italian Left has the potential to get rid of him once and for all., /index.html, Noah Caldwell-Gatsos, mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com, @ Noah, 8/20/19, 3:59PM CST, /projects/geo/images/bp4front.jpeg, Italy‚Äôs Parliament Faces an Uncertain Future, By: Nils @ Unsplash.com.," Matteo Salvini just had a very bad week. It started with his ill-fated attempt to force his coalition partners to accept a deal to create a bullet train between Lyon, France and Turin and ended with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte eviscerating his manhood and actions on live television during his resignation speech this afternoon. With the bad blood generated between Salvini and Italian majority party Movimiento Cinque Stelle in recent weeks and Conte‚Äôs fiery disavowal of his policies, Italy‚Äôs leading coalition has been shattered. In its place, Salvini‚Äôs rivals - the Italian Democratic Party de facto led by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Florence - seem poised to take their place in governing the country."," Things didn‚Äôt start out this way. After an impressive showing in the Spring European Parliamentary Elections, Salvini‚Äôs far-right Lega Nord coalition was leading in the polls and widely believed to be stealing their coalition partner‚Äôs thunder. Rumors spread around Rome that Salvini was plotting to call for a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Conte and petition the President for snap elections. These efforts have largely stalled because of his miserable timing. If he had called for the elections just months earlier, an election could have been organized and Lega Nord would have won in a landslide with more than 30% of the total vote. At the very least, they would take M5S‚Äôs dominant position at the top of the Italian political food chain. But Salvini forgot about a very mundane, routine need: the Italians must pass a budget by mid-October. "," The Italian constitution requires that both Houses of Parliament pass a budget by December 31st, while membership in the European Union requires that they pass one by mid-October. After making himself the Head of Government, Salvini could have easily used a panic around the budget to solidify his own support and leverage its passage to begin Italy‚Äôs departure from the EU - a longstanding goal of Lega Nord. Instead, Salvini wasted time on a bizarre attempt to slash the number of handsomely-paid legislators in half - a perennial reform proposed by Italian politicians but always viciously opposed by legislators wanting to keep their cushy positions. Instead of using his momentum after the European Parliament elections, Salvini decided to get stuck in a bog. He continued to exacerbate tensions with his coalition partners - his ego seemingly inflated from his strong performance in the prior elections. Then on August 20th, they decided enough was enough. Prime Minister Conte, an independent neutral choice with ties to both Lega Nord and M5S, abruptly cut ties with Salvini and tendered his resignation to President Mattarella. ","Italian politics are now almost completely reversed from their equally chaotic situation in 2018. In a prime example of ‚Äúthe enemy of my enemy is my friend,‚Äù former enemies Luigi di Maio of M5S and Matteo Renzi of the Democratic Party are discussing forming a coalition. This is a far cry from 2018, where both parties were at each others throats, and the Movement‚Äôs founder - comedian Beppe Grillo - publicly insulted Renzi‚Äôs government. Salvini‚Äôs own coalition - made up of a variety of xenophobic, rich, Northern parties and factions, is reexamining their relationship with the man now the primary opposition to the government. Salvini made a lot of economic promises to gain their support, and he hasn‚Äôt delivered in the year he‚Äôs been in power. Now that he‚Äôs out, there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt a lot of loyalty between the camps. "," There are still a couple of uncertainties. President Mattarella - a prominent non-aligned Italian academic prior to his ascension to the Presidency, hates everybody for being incompetent. He was reportedly infuriated when M5S and Lega Nord couldn‚Äôt figure out how to split power and told them he‚Äôd call for new elections if they didn‚Äôt find a compromise. The Democrats and M5S have very, very little in common - with opposing financial, immigration, and social platforms on top of their former mutual enmity. It is up to Mattarella to allow the pair to form a government or call for new elections. Even further, the de jure Secretary of the Democratic Party, Nicola Zingaretti, has openly said he‚Äôll do everything in his power to prevent a coalition from forming. However, Zingaretti‚Äôs showing up to the battle without much of an army - Renzi‚Äôs been controlling everything from the shadows for a year now (prompting speculation that he might use the chaos to go rogue and form his own brand new hybrid M5S/Democratic Party) and he has the loyalty of the party‚Äôs Senators behind him. In addition to the urgent need to pass a budget on time to reassure foreign investors of Italy‚Äôs stability - a concern that Mattarella places utmost importance on - and Salvini‚Äôs threat to cut the Parliament in half, nearly everyone in the Italian Government has every incentive to give the bird to Salvini and form a governing coalition.",Italy, EU, Salvini, Conte, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-20/conte-brands-salvini-irresponsible-for-sparking-italian-crisis, Conte Resigns As Italian Premier After Eviscerating Salvini‚Äôs Power Grab, https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-conte-resigns/, Italian Prime Minister Conte Dissolves the Government, https://www.ft.com/content/9e7c46fa-c354-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9, Tensions Remain Between Potential New Italian Coalition Partners," Perhaps this is what Salvini always wanted - he‚Äôs best in the opposition. It‚Äôs where he doesn‚Äôt have to prove he‚Äôs competent at governing, he just has to yell loudly and attend rallies. But considering how his allies in Milan and Veneto are getting cold feet and Rome has soundly rejected him, he‚Äôll be nursing his wounds for a while. At the very least, with Salvini thrown out of the government until the official elections in 2023 or snap elections if the M5S and Democrat Alliance fails, there is zero chance of Italian legislators getting their act together and coordinating enough to draft a concerted effort to leave the European Union. "," The next couple of weeks will determine whether or not Italian finances will suffer - in an especially bad time considering signs that Germany is slowly entering a recession. If the Left can demonstrate they can pass a budget and collaborate successfully, not only will they rescue Italy‚Äôs financial standing, but they have a chance of squashing the Italian far-right once and for all. All they have to do is accomplish a feat Italian politicians haven‚Äôt managed in three decades: govern well. ",,,,,,,,,
