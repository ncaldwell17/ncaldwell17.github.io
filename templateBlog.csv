1,How to Win Montana,Helena Mayor Wilmot Collins faces an uphill battle to retake the Montana Senate seat from the Republicans.,/index.html,Noah Caldwell-Gatsos,mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,7/12/19,12:13AM EST,/projects/elections/images/wilmot.jpg,Mayor Collins addresses a crowd in Helena following Sen. Daines affirmation of the 'send her back chant.',Google Images,"There's only a limited number of Democratic voters in Montana - at least as far as the data shows. Montana went for Trump by 26 points in the 2016 General Election. However, the data misses several key points about the state. Montana's only sent three Republican Senators to Washington since the 70s. Sen. John Tester (D) has represented the state since 2006, weathering a Republican wave year in 2012 and still being reelected in 2018 despite evidence that voters in modern Senate races elect purely based on partisanship rather than individual merit. Gov. Steve Bullock (D) became governor and won reelection the same year Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the state handily. Montana is its own political beast, largely because of the high number of independent-centrist voters that find passion behind both conservative and liberal causes. The question for 2020 - can a relatively liberal, Black, former refugee Democrat win in a state with such an established Republican presidential voting record and a population that is more than 90% white?","Helena Mayor Wilmot Collins was an Independent prior to 2019, largely fitting in the mold with most pundit descriptions of Montana (most Mayors of U.S. cities are officially independents regardless of party preferences). He became Mayor of Helena after winning 51% of the vote against a four-term incumbent, drawing on his two decades of military experience in the U.S. Navy Reserve and experience fleeing Liberia after their first Civil War. Since his historic win in 2018, he's since taken the national stage, appearing on the Daily Show and being featured twice in the Intercept. He's spoken out publicly against the Montana Republican incumbent's rhetoric and fervent embrace of the Trump Administration's hostile rhetoric towards refugees and POCs while maintaining that his bid for Senate will remain free of partisanship. He will likely make immigration central to his campaign - notable as Montana has only recently started to accept refugees. His unique bid is interesting, but can his narrative beat out his competitors for the chance to take on the Republicans?","Local businessman and veteran John Mues has recently announced he would also run in the Democratic primary taking place in late June.  His lack of elected office isn't a particular roadblock to his Senate ambitions - neither current statewide Rep. Gianforte nor his 2017 challenger Quist held elected office beforehand, but it will make it difficult. All of Montana's current high-rank statewide positions are held by individuals who previous held elected office. It is unlikely that Mues would prevail over Collins. The real unknown is whether or not Gov. Steve Bullock will end his campaign to become the 2020 Democratic Nominee for President if he lags in the polls and returns to Montana to run for Senate before the filing deadline. If Bullock returns, it would immediately crush Collins' chances. Bullock is the face of a massive Montana-based fundraising machine, and his statewide recognition and appeal would clear the race. Previous Democratic governor Brian Schweitzer is also considering a bid, who would present an additional formidable challenge to Collins. Schweitzer has been out of politics for nearly a decade, which has been proven to hurt politicians trying to come out of retirement to run for office. Bullock remains the only real threat - and he's reportedly advising his fundraising partners to avoid Collins' campaign and solely focus on getting his Lt. Gov. elected to the Governor's mansion. This indicates that Bullock is trying to keep a backdoor to the Senate open if his presidential ambitions fade. Regardless of the eventual nominee - be it Collins or Bullock, what would a Montanan Democrat have to do to wrest the Senate seat from the Republicans?","Montana's elected an eclectic mix of politicians in the past couple of decades - from progressives, tea party Republicans, libertarian-Republicans, to moderate Democrats. A Democratic hopeful with progressive, populist leanings would need to target the main areas that Clinton performed well in 2016 to solidify their base. Their base: Missoula and Bozeman. Missoula is home to the University of Montana while Bozeman is the location of Montana State University. This is the liberal center of the state and home to 25% or so of potential voters. Old mining towns like Butte and Havre are probably the next best bet - they went for Clinton with 48% of the vote and Bullock with a whopping 67%, Tester with 55%. Collins' advantage? Helena, with its status as the largest swing county in Montana. It has a large state government workforce and tends to lean Democratic, not to mention that it holds 15% of the population. Helena voters wanted Collins as their mayor, so what's to say they won't go for him for Senate? That total gives Collins a shaky 45% of the vote, with his odds in the mining villages and Helena uncertain. His biggest weaknesses are the open counties of Billings and Kalispell at either end of the state - they have a few suburbanites that might be persuaded to vote Democratic, but have often gone for Republicans in statewide elections, as well as rural Montana. Rural Montana is pretty heavily Republican, though there are several Native American tribes like the Blackfeet Nation and Crow Nation that vote Democratic and they have a history of supporting candidates they personally know. Collins' coalition is urban - focusing on maximizing turnout from educated professionals while making inroads to rural areas and voters that might otherwise not vote. Montana makes this simple - it's a small state, population-wise, and voters reward candidates who make an attempt to get to know them. ","Early indicators that Collins is doing well will be large fundraising hauls in the 3rd and 4th quarters, Bullock continuing to plow into the Democratic field until he's thrown out (and missing the filing deadline), and Trump further polarizing the race against his party. Until the preliminary opinion polls come out of Montana voters, there's no way to know how he'll fare against Sen. Daines. Past statewide elections in Montana seem to suggest that a Democrat can win if they stick to a moderate platform, raise enough money to campaign everywhere in the state, are recognizable and familiar to Montanans, and don't try and make the campaign about national issues. In the age of Trump, this might not be enough to tear the state away from its partisan lean - but Collins unique appeal (not to mention that he can never run for President) might be a perfect counterbalance/contrast to the President.

Only time will tell for now - it's a bit too far out to begin making concrete estimates, especially with Bullock being a potential upset. Montana seems to be bucking the national trend of voting solely through partisan lens - if only because they didn't have too many partisans to begin with. One thing's for sure - we'll be waiting for the results till the last minute of November 3rd: Montana takes forever to count their ballots.",,,,,,,,,,How to Win Montana
2,Diversity in American Politics from 2008 to 2019,"Democrats currently hold the mantle of the 'big tent,' multiracial, gender-parity party in the common perception American politics, but does this accurately reflect the realities of the past decade?",/index.html,Noah Caldwell-Gatsos,mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,7/29/19,6:45PM CST,/projects/elections/images/rdebates.jpg,2016 Republican Primary Debates with Donald Trump flanked by Sen. Rubio and Sen. Cruz,Google images,"Especially given the harsh racist rhetoric that's been emanating from President Donald Trump in the past two weeks, it's easy to picture the Democratic Party as the party of diversity. This point is hammered in given the disparity in representation of racial minorities, sexual orientations, and gender in the House, the Democrats have 88 women compared to the Republicans' 13. There is a total of 49 black representatives in the House, but only 1 of them is Republican, and out of 36 Hispanic representatives, only three of them are Republican. Republicans have no representatives of East Asian, South Asian, or Middle Eastern descent (Justin Amash (I-MI) left the party on the 4th of July). No Republican representatives identify as LGBT, while 4 Democrats do. Only two Republican representatives, Lee Zeldin (R-NY) and David Kustoff (R-TN), are Jewish, while 22 Democrats identify as Jewish. Both parties have two representatives of Native American descent, while Democrats have two Muslim women currently serving in Congress. It is easy to put these data into an op ed about the Republicans rapidly becoming the party of White men. But has it always been this way? Prior to Donald Trump's election, Republicans were diversifying at a much slower rate than the Democratic Party, but they had begun to rectify their image as the party of white supremacy. ","In 2013, South Carolina, a former bastion of the KKK and Jim Crow laws - had elected an Indian American female governor, Nikki Haley, who proceeded to appoint a black state legislator, Tim Scott, to the vacant South Carolina senate seat. Sen. Scott remained the only African American Senator in Congress until Cory Booker's election later that year and Kamala Harris' election in 2016. In 2016, the Republicans had a primary where four of the top six competitors consisted of a prominent businesswoman, two Hispanic (of Cuban descent) Senators, and a black neurosurgeon (while the Democrats had no people of color in a primary to succeed the first Black president). At the time, Democrats had only one POC Governor (David Ige of Hawaii), while Republicans had Susana Martinez of New Mexico, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Nikki Haley, Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, and Brian Sandoval of Nevada. That much representation among the Republicans, especially when contrasted with the Democrats', seems like the call of a forgotten era, but was only three years ago. That much changed had happened in a short time as well - almost all of those representatives and executives were elected around the same period (2010-2014). It is strange to imagine the Republicans as the party of Hispanic interests, but these powerful Hispanic and Indian Republican politicians should remind Democrats that they do not have a lock on those voters simply because of one racist President. ","I say this not to excuse the Republican Party's recent racist bent (hi Steve King) and the racist apologizers in Congress protecting the President because of their allegiance to their party and fear of backlash amongst their base. Instead, I want to point attention towards the way that the Democratic Party has been taking people of color for granted since the Clinton Administration. Black and Hispanic voters (of Mexican, Dominican, and Puerto Rican descent) arguably handed Democrats their most essential wins at a presidential level since the Republican Party once again became a dominant force in the country with President Reagan's administration. There is no excuse for the abject indifference the Clinton Campaign ignored people of color in 2016 - which is why she lost. Sure, the Democratic Party had lost the votes of the white working class in the Midwest, but those votes were also heavily dependent on changing demographics and cultural reaction to those demographics. There's only so much political strategy could have done to win those groups over, and I'm not sure I would've liked it if the Party did. But do you know what could be rectified by strategy? Actually targeting and appealing to POC groups scattered throughout the Midwest and the South. Clinton could have chosen a number of prominent Hispanic and black politicians as her running mate, rather than some random white Senator from Virginia. Clinton could have aggressively made appearances in black communities in Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Atlanta rather than just hoping her offhand remark that she carried hot sauce in her purse would encourage them to vote for her. She barely brought up immigration and illegal amnesty at all during the campaign, despite Trump making it a central focus to his. Heck, the Democratic Party could have refused to all but hand Clinton the nomination without a serious primary by refusing to offer endorsements until the primary season started, scheduling proper debates, and tempering internal discussions that Clinton was the presumptive nominee. She had already lost a primary - why should she have been given a second chance in such a way? ","Politicians attempting to run for President in 2020 should take note of galvanizing campaigns in 2018. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams - a popular black legislator - made race a central focus to her campaign for governor and nearly won a state that Democrats hadn't touched in decades. Sen. Doug Jones made overtures to black women the number one priority of his Senate race against Roy Moore in Alabama. Hispanic voters are the reason that there is a Democratic Senator from Arizona. Joe Biden seems to think that his connection to the nation's first black president is reason enough for Black voters to support him - lumping them all in a single group without much regard to unique and varied needs within the group. All black and Hispanic voters do not believe in the same political philosophy and many would appreciate a varied approach like the one granted to white voters of all economic classes. As of July 2019, only two candidates are really making diverse offerings to all racial groups of varying socio-economic interests - Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro. Castro's gone the furthest, offering comprehensive plans to support Native American communities long ignored, Mexican immigrants and their children, working class Black men and women, Hispanic Americans with long histories in their states wanting to see more representation and attention, and established, educated POC professionals facing discriminatory workplace environments who also want to see the same kind of economic change as their white counterparts. ","Donald Trump and his administration, along with the Republicans are not implementing policies for all Americans. Their blatant racism makes them easy targets for Democratic attack ads and messaging. However, it would be a grave mistake for the Democratic party to forget that only three years ago, it seemed like Republicans had a firm foundation from which to challenge their presumed dominance over Hispanic votes. Trump is certainly not someone who we would like to continue to see in the Oval Office in 2021 and getting over taking POC votes as something for granted is essential to remove the man from Washington. Democrats need to take note from Justice Democrats, Black Lives Matter, and the varying progressive think tanks attempting to redefine policies towards race and make it a centerpiece of their campaigns. They need to aggressively campaign for election reform - ensuring that every American, regardless of socio-economic status is able to easily vote, they need to rectify the grave injustices that have been perpetrated against POC of lower socio-economic classes under the guise of a 'war on drugs' and their subsequent imprisonment and disenfranchisement, and they need to offer comprehensive immigration reform messaging - it is not enough to offer substantial policies - it is necessary to convince the American public why these are necessary. Candidates who follow that narrow playbook and continue to find innovative ways to solve the myriad issues facing communities of color while listening to their concerns will be the most successful in 2020 and the decades beyond. Democrats cannot allow Republicans to continue racist policies with POC support simply because of their indifference. They need to properly understand race and how modern Americans view it, and weaponize it.

3,Warren's Going to Dominate the Second Democratic Debates.,"On a stage with five moderates who'll attack Sanders the first night and her two rivals destroying each other the second, Warren's going to rise above it all.",/index.html,Noah Caldwell-Gatsos,mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,7/30/19,12:00AM CST,/projects/elections/images/ddebates.jpg,,Google Images,This is the last chance for many of the Democratic candidates polling at 1% to really make an impact to qualify for the September debates. They couldn't have asked for a better hand. All the moderates were given the perfect targets: progressive frontrunners Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders the first night. All the progressives were given the moderate frontrunners Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the second. You can bet that they're going to be in attack mode. ,"Harris is probably in the worst position this time around - which would make an impressive performance even more extraordinary if she manages to pull it off. She just released her first, real proposal for healthcare - and has already been pummeled by the left and right. Biden will be much more prepared for a race-based onslaught on Wednesday, and Kamala won't have that lane to herself with all of the candidates of color unfortunately grouped together on the same night. She won't even be able to benefit from a potential tag team support like Warren and Sanders will the first night, she's spent so much time trying to define a lane for herself that she'll be alone. Wednesday will be the night that we might see Harris fall and Booker or Castro finally rise. Or Kamala will prove beyond a doubt that she's the perfect person to take on Trump by outflanking all her rivals and playing a bad hand masterfully. It remains to be seen.","But by continuing to separate Warren and Harris in the only real events that matter this far ahead of the Iowa primaries, the media have all but ensured one, or both of their rise. Warren and Harris essentially have the same voters - surprising many and overturning the attempted media spin that Warren and Sanders are in the same lane. Analytics venues like FiveThirtyEight have proven that most Biden supporters consider Bernie their second choice, and vice versa. The same goes for Warren and Harris, for whatever odd reason (neither pairing has remotely similar policies). By keeping the pairs separate, the media has prevented those voters from contrasting the candidates that the data says they want to contrast and almost forcing the media narrative of Biden vs Harris and Warren vs Bernie down our throats. Because there's only a limited number of events like these and their actual tangible effect on public perception, it ensures that the eventual frontrunner matchup will be one of those later two pairs, instead of the one that voters actually want. ","I believe the final matchup in September and beyond will be Warren vs Biden. Sanders really overestimated how much of his 2016 support was really just a protest vote against Clinton, and for someone with nearly 100% name recognition he's polling horribly. Party activists have continually placed him at the top of lists of who they don't want to see as the nominee, he has a horrible relationship with the media (meaning he'll get less favorable coverage and continue to be framed as the 'annoying candidate'), he often goes off script and does his own thing in contrast to what his policy directors tell him, and his fundraising has been lackluster in comparison to the rest of the field. Like I mentioned above, unless Kamala really does a great job in Wednesday's debate, I think she'll be the top target instead of Biden. Her polling bump's already gone down since the June debates and she hasn't managed to recreate the durable rise that Warren's perfected.","Which brings us back to the first premise - Warren's going to shine again in tomorrow's debate. The last thing the moderates want is to be made to look like an idiot on stage - precisely why Warren dominated the first time around. Nobody wanted to give her room to prove them wrong. Just see poor Tim Ryan in the last debate - he was annihilated by Tulsi Gabbard and got mocked all over the internet. You don't attack someone on their own turf - and Warren's the policy master on everything. All she wants is someone to give her a platform to prove them wrong - that's her whole brand. But it's not Bernie's. Bernie thrived off his energy, his massive promises, and incomplete policies designed to spark inspiration and hope instead of confidence. He's the perfect target for these wonky moderates. Sure, he'll have Warren helping him - everytime he stumbles will be more ways for her to get speaking time in - but while he's fending off personal attacks, Warren's help is going to come off as the teacher helping the clumsy student. He's stuck between a rock and a hard place and it'd be shocking if he can extract himself from it.",Democrats,Primaries,2020,President,https://www.salon.com/2019/07/29/are-democrats-ready-to-fight-the-signs-arent-promising-this-weeks-debates-are-crucial/,Are Democrats ready to fight?

She's currently polling at 15% nationwide (tie w/ Sanders for 2nd), 15% in Iowa (tie w/ Harris for 2nd), and 18% in New Hampshire (2nd). I don't think these debates will push her past Biden - yet - but I think it will solidify her in second place only a few points behind him. From readings, post debate bumps seem to have diminishing returns the higher polling a candidate is (i.e. Harris pre-June debates was polling around 8%, Harris doubled her share and is currently polling between 12-16%, while Warren pre-debates was polling around 12-14% and is currently polling around 15-17%). Due to this estimate there won't be a massive shift in support, but I think that she will receive a boost of 3% across the board. In National, Iowa, and New Hampshire polls she will gain at the expense of Biden, Harris, and Sanders, all of whom I predict will suffer in this debate. Biden and Warren will stay fairly neck and neck for the remainder of the Summer - Biden ahead by 8 points Nationally with 27% support, 3-4 points ahead with 21% support in Iowa, and 21% in NH. Warren won't surpass Biden until their debate in September - the first time they both will be on stage. That will make for some fireworks - Warren has been an antagonist of Biden long before she became a Senator and national figure. Biden, as the Wall Street-loving Delaware corporate enabler, represents everything Warren has spent her life fighting against. He'll be an appetizer before she eviscerates Trump.

4,Elizabeth Warren is the Democratic Ronald Reagan,The question is whether or not she can mobilize the Democrats to such a landslide victory that she redefines American politics for a generation. ,/index.html,Noah Caldwell-Gatsos,mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,7/30/19,11:42PM  CST,/projects/elections/images/warrenreagan.jpg,President Reagan and Sen. Warren,Google Images,"Something Nate Silver on FiveThirtyEight mentioned <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-midsummer-overview-of-the-democratic-field/"">the other day</a> was intriguing.","Warren is offering more red meat (or should it be blue meat?) and would represent more of a leftward transformation from the status quo, she's <a href=https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/moderate-democrats-surprising-embrace-of-eli zabeth-warren-at-the-democratic-debate""> simpatico enough with the party elite </a>and has <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-elizabeth-warren-could-win-the-2020-democratic-primary/ ""> broad enough appeal </a>that she isn't necessarily a factional candidate in the way that Sanders is. Instead, a better analogy for Warren might be Ronald Reagan; they are not comparable in terms of their backgrounds or their political styles, but they are both candidates who straddle the boundary between the ideological wings of their party and the party establishment.""","Silver goes on to emphasize that Warren's strategy is the path less taken in American politics. Biden's Ônext in line' lane (HW Bush, Mondale, Gore, Kerry, Hillary Clinton) and Harris's Ôcoalition-builder' lane (Bill Clinton, Obama) have produced more recent winners than Warren's - though I'd argue that a Ônext-in-line' strategy hasn't worked for decades to elect a winner who would go on to win the Presidency. All three are polling reasonably well at the moment, so Silver concludes that they're all in the top three of his choices to win the Primary. So let's go to my main premise - Warren is the Democratic reincarnation of Ronald Reagan. How did Reagan win the 1980 Primaries to go on to fight President Carter?","Reagan initially lost his first and second nomination attempts to represent the Republicans in 1968 and 1976 versus former Vice President Richard Nixon and later incumbent President Gerald Ford. He was obviously successful on his third try, beating his rival, the former Director of the CIA, H.W. Bush of Texas. The 1980 Republican Primary was nowhere near as crowded as the 2020 Democratic Primary is now, but H.W. Bush was thought of as the establishment candidate. He was the head of the Republican National Committee and had already served in a previous Republican President's cabinet. Even so, Reagan was widely considered the early favorite to win the nomination because he was so far ahead in the polls. Reagan lost Iowa to Bush but won in New Hampshire. Reagan went on to sweep the South, win California, and became the Republican nominee without much fanfare or contested conventions.","Obviously, there are many dissonances between Reagan's fate and Warren's future. She is not the current frontrunner, though I'd counter that by saying that Democrats initially prefer establishment candidates and continued governance until a new candidate captures public attention (i.e. Hillary Clinton vs. Obama), while Republicans' brand is that they like disestablishment candidates and are much more likely to support an outsider. Biden's early lead isn't something to ignore, but it is something to take with a grain of salt. Clinton ran ahead of Obama by more than 20 points for much of 2007. I predict that Biden or Harris will win Iowa, but Warren will win New Hampshire - similar to 1980. The biggest issue for Warren will be the South. It is easy for a Republican candidate to win both New Hampshire and South Carolina - they're essentially the same constituencies. It is harder for a Democratic candidate to do the same. Winning Iowa would be a better indicator of success in the South for a Democrat, as seen from Obama's example in 2008. To sweep the South, Warren would need to spectacularly raise her profile among black voters, which dominate the Democratic primaries. There is a big interest among black voters to be seen as a diverse block with varying interests. Older individuals want Joe Biden - who they see as carrying Obama's legacy and supported  by their chosen leaders in Congress. Younger members see themselves in Kamala Harris and see her as someone who shares their same experiences. Warren's path to victory? Winning over those who want more than just vague promises and nostalgia, but a working plan for the future that addresses their unique issues and inspires confidence. If Warren gets that part of her strategy down pat, she'll be on track towards inheriting Reagan's success. Otherwise, it is likely that the nomination will be hard for any candidate as Biden dominates the heartland, Harris the South and California, and Warren everywhere else. Biden or Harris faltering earlier than expected would also propel Warren to the nomination faster.

Carter had a wild foreign environment in 1980, facing disastrous results from his handling of the Iran Contra Affair that threatened his mandate.

","Could there be Warren-Republicans the same way that there were Reagan-Democrats? This - above anything - will be the marker of a true shift in American politics. Reagan was only able to become a successful President because his landslide victory against Carter (489 vs. 49 electoral votes) handed Republicans such a powerful electoral mandate. With this victory came a sea change of +12 Republican seats in the Senate, giving the Republicans control of the upper chamber and full control of the Executive Branch's main functions (the Senate, through their ability to approve Executive and Judicial nominees and their role as the main legislative branch's main conduit for Foreign Policy arguably exerts a significant role over Executive power). A President Warren would need a comfortable majority around the size of the Republican's current hold (i.e. 53 to 47 seats) to effect a lot of her proposed policy changes. Maintaining control of the House would also go a long way towards avoiding Republican obstructionism. ","This observation bares almost no statistical significance to Warren's eventual performance against Trump, but it's worth noting that in the 1980 Election matchup between incumbent President Carter and Ronald Reagan, he won his challenge. Carter was a vastly unpopular first term President, party activists were itching for a larger role in the electoral process after eight years of Nixon & Ford's tepid Conservative leadership, and the economy had just experienced a big shock under a decade previously. America's too young and these presidential contests have too many variables to really create sustainable trends - but for the sake of a fun hypothetical, Reagan and Warren share many similarities.",,,,,,,,Elizabeth Warren is the Democratic Ronald Reagan
