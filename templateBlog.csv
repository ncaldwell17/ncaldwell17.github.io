1,How to Win Montana,Helena Mayor Wilmot Collins faces an uphill battle to retake the Montana Senate seat from the Republicans.,/index.html,Noah Caldwell-Gatsos,mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,7/12/19,12:13AM EST,/projects/elections/images/wilmot.jpg,Mayor Collins addresses a crowd in Helena following Sen. Daines affirmation of the 'send her back chant.',Google Images,"There's only a limited number of Democratic voters in Montana - at least as far as the data shows. Montana went for Trump by 26 points in the 2016 General Election. However, the data misses several key points about the state. Montana's only sent three Republican Senators to Washington since the 70s. Sen. John Tester (D) has represented the state since 2006, weathering a Republican wave year in 2012 and still being reelected in 2018 despite evidence that voters in modern Senate races elect purely based on partisanship rather than individual merit. Gov. Steve Bullock (D) became governor and won reelection the same year Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the state handily. Montana is its own political beast, largely because of the high number of independent-centrist voters that find passion behind both conservative and liberal causes. The question for 2020 - can a relatively liberal, Black, former refugee Democrat win in a state with such an established Republican presidential voting record and a population that is more than 90% white?","Helena Mayor Wilmot Collins was an Independent prior to 2019, largely fitting in the mold with most pundit descriptions of Montana (most Mayors of U.S. cities are officially independents regardless of party preferences). He became Mayor of Helena after winning 51% of the vote against a four-term incumbent, drawing on his two decades of military experience in the U.S. Navy Reserve and experience fleeing Liberia after their first Civil War. Since his historic win in 2018, he's since taken the national stage, appearing on the Daily Show and being featured twice in the Intercept. He's spoken out publicly against the Montana Republican incumbent's rhetoric and fervent embrace of the Trump Administration's hostile rhetoric towards refugees and POCs while maintaining that his bid for Senate will remain free of partisanship. He will likely make immigration central to his campaign - notable as Montana has only recently started to accept refugees. His unique bid is interesting, but can his narrative beat out his competitors for the chance to take on the Republicans?","Local businessman and veteran John Mues has recently announced he would also run in the Democratic primary taking place in late June.  His lack of elected office isn't a particular roadblock to his Senate ambitions - neither current statewide Rep. Gianforte nor his 2017 challenger Quist held elected office beforehand, but it will make it difficult. All of Montana's current high-rank statewide positions are held by individuals who previous held elected office. It is unlikely that Mues would prevail over Collins. The real unknown is whether or not Gov. Steve Bullock will end his campaign to become the 2020 Democratic Nominee for President if he lags in the polls and returns to Montana to run for Senate before the filing deadline. If Bullock returns, it would immediately crush Collins' chances. Bullock is the face of a massive Montana-based fundraising machine, and his statewide recognition and appeal would clear the race. Previous Democratic governor Brian Schweitzer is also considering a bid, who would present an additional formidable challenge to Collins. Schweitzer has been out of politics for nearly a decade, which has been proven to hurt politicians trying to come out of retirement to run for office. Bullock remains the only real threat - and he's reportedly advising his fundraising partners to avoid Collins' campaign and solely focus on getting his Lt. Gov. elected to the Governor's mansion. This indicates that Bullock is trying to keep a backdoor to the Senate open if his presidential ambitions fade. Regardless of the eventual nominee - be it Collins or Bullock, what would a Montanan Democrat have to do to wrest the Senate seat from the Republicans?","Montana's elected an eclectic mix of politicians in the past couple of decades - from progressives, tea party Republicans, libertarian-Republicans, to moderate Democrats. A Democratic hopeful with progressive, populist leanings would need to target the main areas that Clinton performed well in 2016 to solidify their base. Their base: Missoula and Bozeman. Missoula is home to the University of Montana while Bozeman is the location of Montana State University. This is the liberal center of the state and home to 25% or so of potential voters. Old mining towns like Butte and Havre are probably the next best bet - they went for Clinton with 48% of the vote and Bullock with a whopping 67%, Tester with 55%. Collins' advantage? Helena, with its status as the largest swing county in Montana. It has a large state government workforce and tends to lean Democratic, not to mention that it holds 15% of the population. Helena voters wanted Collins as their mayor, so what's to say they won't go for him for Senate? That total gives Collins a shaky 45% of the vote, with his odds in the mining villages and Helena uncertain. His biggest weaknesses are the open counties of Billings and Kalispell at either end of the state - they have a few suburbanites that might be persuaded to vote Democratic, but have often gone for Republicans in statewide elections, as well as rural Montana. Rural Montana is pretty heavily Republican, though there are several Native American tribes like the Blackfeet Nation and Crow Nation that vote Democratic and they have a history of supporting candidates they personally know. Collins' coalition is urban - focusing on maximizing turnout from educated professionals while making inroads to rural areas and voters that might otherwise not vote. Montana makes this simple - it's a small state, population-wise, and voters reward candidates who make an attempt to get to know them. ","Early indicators that Collins is doing well will be large fundraising hauls in the 3rd and 4th quarters, Bullock continuing to plow into the Democratic field until he's thrown out (and missing the filing deadline), and Trump further polarizing the race against his party. Until the preliminary opinion polls come out of Montana voters, there's no way to know how he'll fare against Sen. Daines. Past statewide elections in Montana seem to suggest that a Democrat can win if they stick to a moderate platform, raise enough money to campaign everywhere in the state, are recognizable and familiar to Montanans, and don't try and make the campaign about national issues. In the age of Trump, this might not be enough to tear the state away from its partisan lean - but Collins unique appeal (not to mention that he can never run for President) might be a perfect counterbalance/contrast to the President.

Only time will tell for now - it's a bit too far out to begin making concrete estimates, especially with Bullock being a potential upset. Montana seems to be bucking the national trend of voting solely through partisan lens - if only because they didn't have too many partisans to begin with. One thing's for sure - we'll be waiting for the results till the last minute of November 3rd: Montana takes forever to count their ballots.",,,,,,,,,,How to Win Montana
2,Diversity in American Politics from 2008 to 2019,"Democrats currently hold the mantle of the 'big tent,' multiracial, gender-parity party in the common perception American politics, but does this accurately reflect the realities of the past decade?",/index.html,Noah Caldwell-Gatsos,mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,7/29/19,6:45PM CST,/projects/elections/images/rdebates.jpg,2016 Republican Primary Debates with Donald Trump flanked by Sen. Rubio and Sen. Cruz,Google images,"Especially given the harsh racist rhetoric that's been emanating from President Donald Trump in the past two weeks, it's easy to picture the Democratic Party as the party of diversity. This point is hammered in given the disparity in representation of racial minorities, sexual orientations, and gender in the House, the Democrats have 88 women compared to the Republicans' 13. There is a total of 49 black representatives in the House, but only 1 of them is Republican, and out of 36 Hispanic representatives, only three of them are Republican. Republicans have no representatives of East Asian, South Asian, or Middle Eastern descent (Justin Amash (I-MI) left the party on the 4th of July). No Republican representatives identify as LGBT, while 4 Democrats do. Only two Republican representatives, Lee Zeldin (R-NY) and David Kustoff (R-TN), are Jewish, while 22 Democrats identify as Jewish. Both parties have two representatives of Native American descent, while Democrats have two Muslim women currently serving in Congress. It is easy to put these data into an op ed about the Republicans rapidly becoming the party of White men. But has it always been this way? Prior to Donald Trump's election, Republicans were diversifying at a much slower rate than the Democratic Party, but they had begun to rectify their image as the party of white supremacy. ","In 2013, South Carolina, a former bastion of the KKK and Jim Crow laws - had elected an Indian American female governor, Nikki Haley, who proceeded to appoint a black state legislator, Tim Scott, to the vacant South Carolina senate seat. Sen. Scott remained the only African American Senator in Congress until Cory Booker's election later that year and Kamala Harris' election in 2016. In 2016, the Republicans had a primary where four of the top six competitors consisted of a prominent businesswoman, two Hispanic (of Cuban descent) Senators, and a black neurosurgeon (while the Democrats had no people of color in a primary to succeed the first Black president). At the time, Democrats had only one POC Governor (David Ige of Hawaii), while Republicans had Susana Martinez of New Mexico, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Nikki Haley, Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, and Brian Sandoval of Nevada. That much representation among the Republicans, especially when contrasted with the Democrats', seems like the call of a forgotten era, but was only three years ago. That much changed had happened in a short time as well - almost all of those representatives and executives were elected around the same period (2010-2014). It is strange to imagine the Republicans as the party of Hispanic interests, but these powerful Hispanic and Indian Republican politicians should remind Democrats that they do not have a lock on those voters simply because of one racist President. ","I say this not to excuse the Republican Party's recent racist bent (hi Steve King) and the racist apologizers in Congress protecting the President because of their allegiance to their party and fear of backlash amongst their base. Instead, I want to point attention towards the way that the Democratic Party has been taking people of color for granted since the Clinton Administration. Black and Hispanic voters (of Mexican, Dominican, and Puerto Rican descent) arguably handed Democrats their most essential wins at a presidential level since the Republican Party once again became a dominant force in the country with President Reagan's administration. There is no excuse for the abject indifference the Clinton Campaign ignored people of color in 2016 - which is why she lost. Sure, the Democratic Party had lost the votes of the white working class in the Midwest, but those votes were also heavily dependent on changing demographics and cultural reaction to those demographics. There's only so much political strategy could have done to win those groups over, and I'm not sure I would've liked it if the Party did. But do you know what could be rectified by strategy? Actually targeting and appealing to POC groups scattered throughout the Midwest and the South. Clinton could have chosen a number of prominent Hispanic and black politicians as her running mate, rather than some random white Senator from Virginia. Clinton could have aggressively made appearances in black communities in Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Atlanta rather than just hoping her offhand remark that she carried hot sauce in her purse would encourage them to vote for her. She barely brought up immigration and illegal amnesty at all during the campaign, despite Trump making it a central focus to his. Heck, the Democratic Party could have refused to all but hand Clinton the nomination without a serious primary by refusing to offer endorsements until the primary season started, scheduling proper debates, and tempering internal discussions that Clinton was the presumptive nominee. She had already lost a primary - why should she have been given a second chance in such a way? ","Politicians attempting to run for President in 2020 should take note of galvanizing campaigns in 2018. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams - a popular black legislator - made race a central focus to her campaign for governor and nearly won a state that Democrats hadn't touched in decades. Sen. Doug Jones made overtures to black women the number one priority of his Senate race against Roy Moore in Alabama. Hispanic voters are the reason that there is a Democratic Senator from Arizona. Joe Biden seems to think that his connection to the nation's first black president is reason enough for Black voters to support him - lumping them all in a single group without much regard to unique and varied needs within the group. All black and Hispanic voters do not believe in the same political philosophy and many would appreciate a varied approach like the one granted to white voters of all economic classes. As of July 2019, only two candidates are really making diverse offerings to all racial groups of varying socio-economic interests - Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro. Castro's gone the furthest, offering comprehensive plans to support Native American communities long ignored, Mexican immigrants and their children, working class Black men and women, Hispanic Americans with long histories in their states wanting to see more representation and attention, and established, educated POC professionals facing discriminatory workplace environments who also want to see the same kind of economic change as their white counterparts. ","Donald Trump and his administration, along with the Republicans are not implementing policies for all Americans. Their blatant racism makes them easy targets for Democratic attack ads and messaging. However, it would be a grave mistake for the Democratic party to forget that only three years ago, it seemed like Republicans had a firm foundation from which to challenge their presumed dominance over Hispanic votes. Trump is certainly not someone who we would like to continue to see in the Oval Office in 2021 and getting over taking POC votes as something for granted is essential to remove the man from Washington. Democrats need to take note from Justice Democrats, Black Lives Matter, and the varying progressive think tanks attempting to redefine policies towards race and make it a centerpiece of their campaigns. They need to aggressively campaign for election reform - ensuring that every American, regardless of socio-economic status is able to easily vote, they need to rectify the grave injustices that have been perpetrated against POC of lower socio-economic classes under the guise of a 'war on drugs' and their subsequent imprisonment and disenfranchisement, and they need to offer comprehensive immigration reform messaging - it is not enough to offer substantial policies - it is necessary to convince the American public why these are necessary. Candidates who follow that narrow playbook and continue to find innovative ways to solve the myriad issues facing communities of color while listening to their concerns will be the most successful in 2020 and the decades beyond. Democrats cannot allow Republicans to continue racist policies with POC support simply because of their indifference. They need to properly understand race and how modern Americans view it, and weaponize it.
