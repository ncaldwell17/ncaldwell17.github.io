1,Why is Hong Kong’s Sovereignty So Important to China?,How a Complex Geopolitical Calculus Informs Beijing's Decisions,/index.html,Noah Caldwell-Gatsos,mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,8/7/19,12:00PM CST,/projects/geo/images/bp1front.jpg,View of the Hong Kong Skyline,Google Images,"Hong Kong represents more than a powerful economic hub for the People’s Republic of China. It’s recent protests are more than just a demand for return to the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ policy. The matter of Hong Kong is of paramount importance to Chinese leaders because of optics. If Beijing allows Hong Kong to resume its sovereignty and right to self governance, they risk allowing the same sentiments to begin growing in other regions unhappy with China’s leadership and aims. ","Despite the immense Han majority in Eastern, Costal China - the Republic’s greater territory is a patchwork of unassociated ethnic groups and socio-cultural beliefs that share little in common with Beijing’s collectivist approach. This is not unique to China - American territories, European colonies, the British Raj, the Japanese Empire’s conquered land, and Soviet satellites possessed many of the same qualities and dissonances. Subjugated locals were (and rightfully so) unhappy with far-away capitals determining their rights and governance. If Beijing allows Hong Kong to gain greater autonomy, they risk giving the green light for Taiwan, Tibet, Macau, Xinjiang, and even some of the central provinces to do the same. Beijing consistently places emphasis on stability and interconnectedness above all other qualities in their rhetoric. The stamp on dissent when it appears, for if it festers, it make provoke a backlash they can’t control. ","This has happened to Beijing several times in China’s recent history. Unlike the United States, Beijing has historically asserted its continent-wide dominance over highly populated communities with long, rich histories. The United States may be the only continent-sized nation that did not have to compensate for its size by accommodating the various mini-nations that lived under its banner. Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Manchuria, and the Coastal Cities all have historically differing interests than a support for a common China. The government in Beijing has fractured at several points throughout history, often when one of the fringe states is empowered by a weak capital, supported by a foreign nation that they share greater ties with, and the Costal Regions are apathetic. Therefore it is no surprise that modern China prioritizes national unity over all other qualities (and might provide one insight why the one-party, authoritarian model is so appealing to Chinese power brokers).","The stakes are about the same for Greater China as they were for the Soviet Union. Like China, the Soviet Union desperately needed the fringe regions for their own geopolitical security. Xinjiang and Tibet are essential parts of China not because they’re economic boons (though they do both possess some important mineral resources), but because they allow China a buffer between themselves and potentially hostile rivals like India or the Russians. Despite cultural dissimilarities between the ethnic groups that populate the two fringe regions and the Han Chinese that control power in Greater China’s political and economic centers, they are on the inner side of natural boundaries that grant the Chinese an ideal strategic position. The Himalayas and the Karakorum Range running through Tibet and Xinjiang are high ground, versus the relatively flat lands that connect the pair of provinces with central China. If the Russians, Turks, or Arabs were to gain a foothold in Xinjiang, they could easily have a garrison to use as leverage against China. Likewise, if Tibet became a client state of the Indians (likely, as Tibet’s relatively unpopulated and has little economic potential), they could just as easily use it to garrison their own troops to use as leverage. Would either group really be a threat to China’s 1-million strong PLA? No. Would it be enough of a nuisance to factor into strategic planning? Without a doubt. ","Like the Domino Theory that caught fire among Western strategists during the Cold War, Beijing views the revolutionary protests of one fringe as a potential spark which could become a wildfire that enflames the rest of the country. Backing off of Hong Kong (or Taiwan for that matter) would signal to activists and protestors in the fringe regions that if they put up a significant fight they could have leverage against Beijing. The Chinese government cannot tolerate this.

2,ISRAEL - A Short Explainer on U.S.-Israel Relations in 2019, Why is it Notable That the Israelis Just Banned Two Members of Congress?, /index.html, Noah Caldwell-Gatsos, mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com, @ Noah, 8/15/19, 12:22PM CST, /projects/geo/images/bp2front.jpg," Reps Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, the first Muslim women elected to congress.", Google Images," Rep. Ilhan Omar (Democrat-MN05) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (Democrat-MI13) have both just been banned from entering Israel. This decision comes just a month after the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer, announced that both lawmakers would be allowed to visit, and two days after President Trump wrote a tweet about it. Here‚Äôs a short explainer on recent events between the U.S. and Israel. "," <b>Why Are They Banned?</b> Rep. Omar and Rep. Tlaib are the second Muslim members of Congress in U.S. history after Omar‚Äôs predecessor, Rep. Keith Ellison. Both have publicly supported the ‚ÄúBoycott Israel Movement‚Äù that calls for a rejection of Israeli products, divestment from American loans and transfers of technology, and sanctions if the Israelis do not withdraw from Palestine. Rep. Tlaib‚Äôs family is from Palestine. The BDS Movement has widely been condemned through the international community, though it has attracted supporters like the ACLU and liberal Jewish think tank J-Street. Israel has banned all public supporters of the BDS Movement from entering the country, but U.S. Members of Congress are an extremely unique case. "," <b>Why is Banning U.S. Members of Congress Extreme?</b> It is a very risky move for Prime Minister Netanyahu‚Äôs government. Despite the goodwill he might have generated from the President, it is the U.S. House of Representatives that approves the billions of dollars given to Israel every year. Taking the unusual step of banning members of Congress risks undermining the bipartisan support that Israel has enjoyed for decades - especially as the Democratic Party controls the House. It is also a question of optics - allowing members of a foreign government access to your country demonstrates that you view them as an ally. Taking away that privilege risks irreparably damaging the relationship, and shifting the paradigm of American voters viewing Israel as an ally. Many U.S. Democratic Candidates for President have already denounced the move alongside prominent U.S. committee chairs. ","<b>Why Does Netanyahu Do What Trump Says?</b> Much of Netanyahu‚Äôs appeal to the Israeli electorate stems with how they view his handling of Israel‚Äôs most important ally. Israel is one of the only countries in the world that holds a positive approval rating of the Trump Administration. He also had a comparatively frosty relationship with the Obama Administration, which began taking steps to divest American funds from Israeli operations. To be an effective Israeli leader, there are a number of objectives that they must achieve through their interaction with the Americans, and Netanyahu and his advisors must have calculated that their relationship with the President and the Republican Party is more important than their relationship with the increasingly skeptical Democratic Party. Netanyahu has a very tough election coming up in October, and is likely eager to distract attention away from his personal and financial scandals. "," <b>What Do Americans Give to Israel?</b> Besides the symbolic gestures that the Trump Administration has granted to Israel in recent years, like the movement of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, we also give a substantial amount of money, logistical, and military aid and directly facilitate U.S. foreign direct investment into the country. This aid is not remarkably different than similar programs granted to secondary allies outside the Pacific Alliance and NATO like Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. You can see a comprehensive, factual, and declassified overview of U.S. foreign aid to Israel <a href=‚Äúhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf‚Äù>here</a>.", Israel, The Squad, Netanyahu, Trump, https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/15/how-and-how-not-to-talk-about-the-israel-lobby/, How (and How Not) to Talk About the Israel Lobby, https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf, U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel, https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/15/israel-ilhan-omar-rashida-tlaib-netanyahu-1463655," Israel Bars Omar, Tlaib from Entering Country As Trump Lashes Out"," <b>Why is it Difficult to Critique Israel as an American?</b> Israel is a paradoxical ally. It is the only stable democracy in the Middle East and has many cultural similarities with the U.S. It provides us with vital intelligence in a hostile region and grants logistical support to our troops. At the same time, it often deliberately undermines U.S. influence and interests by taking geopolitically risky actions it determines to be in the defense of their country, like physically attacking Iran-backed groups in Lebanon and Syria, launching cyberattacks against Iran and other nations, ignoring potential life-threatening consequences to our troops, and committing human rights abuses against the Palestinians within their sphere of control. Whether these actions are morally defensible in the name of national security is a concern for a much, much longer paper, but in this paper‚Äôs window: are these actions worthy of U.S. taxpayer support?"," <b>Is it Politically Unpopular to Critique U.S. Policy on Israel?</b> Americans absolutely can and should have qualms about aspects of the U.S.-Israeli relationship, but any criticisms must be weighed with the history of political action against Jews. There‚Äôs a variety of very widespread misconceptions about the Israeli-U.S. relationship that often possess origins in anti-Semitic tropes. They usually involve money - Rep. Omar was widely condemned for her use of ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about those Benjamins baby‚Äù tweet to imply that it was Jewish-backed money that encouraged positive U.S. policy towards Israel. It is also widely believed that advocacy groups like AIPAC donate money to candidates, which they do not. The American black community in particular has a troubled history with the American Jewish community, with Jewish votes derailing Jesse Jackson‚Äôs presidential/vice presidential bids in 1984, 1988, and 1992 and anti-Semitic views coming from black Muslims throughout the 20th century.", EP3, EP4, EP5, EP6, EP7, EP8, EP9, EP10,
