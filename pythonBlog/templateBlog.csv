1,How to Win Montana,Helena Mayor Wilmot Collins faces an uphill battle to retake the Montana Senate seat from the Republicans.,/index.html,Noah Caldwell-Gatsos,mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,7/12/19,12:13AM EST,/projects/elections/images/wilmot.jpg,Mayor Collins addresses a crowd in Helena following Sen. Daines affirmation of the 'send her back chant.',Google Images,"There's only a limited number of Democratic voters in Montana - at least as far as the data shows. Montana went for Trump by 26 points in the 2016 General Election. However, the data misses several key points about the state. Montana's only sent three Republican Senators to Washington since the 70s. Sen. John Tester (D) has represented the state since 2006, weathering a Republican wave year in 2012 and still being reelected in 2018 despite evidence that voters in modern Senate races elect purely based on partisanship rather than individual merit. Gov. Steve Bullock (D) became governor and won reelection the same year Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the state handily. Montana is its own political beast, largely because of the high number of independent-centrist voters that find passion behind both conservative and liberal causes. The question for 2020 - can a relatively liberal, Black, former refugee Democrat win in a state with such an established Republican presidential voting record and a population that is more than 90% white?","Helena Mayor Wilmot Collins was an Independent prior to 2019, largely fitting in the mold with most pundit descriptions of Montana (most Mayors of U.S. cities are officially independents regardless of party preferences). He became Mayor of Helena after winning 51% of the vote against a four-term incumbent, drawing on his two decades of military experience in the U.S. Navy Reserve and experience fleeing Liberia after their first Civil War. Since his historic win in 2018, he's since taken the national stage, appearing on the Daily Show and being featured twice in the Intercept. He's spoken out publicly against the Montana Republican incumbent's rhetoric and fervent embrace of the Trump Administration's hostile rhetoric towards refugees and POCs while maintaining that his bid for Senate will remain free of partisanship. He will likely make immigration central to his campaign - notable as Montana has only recently started to accept refugees. His unique bid is interesting, but can his narrative beat out his competitors for the chance to take on the Republicans?","Local businessman and veteran John Mues has recently announced he would also run in the Democratic primary taking place in late June.  His lack of elected office isn't a particular roadblock to his Senate ambitions - neither current statewide Rep. Gianforte nor his 2017 challenger Quist held elected office beforehand, but it will make it difficult. All of Montana's current high-rank statewide positions are held by individuals who previous held elected office. It is unlikely that Mues would prevail over Collins. The real unknown is whether or not Gov. Steve Bullock will end his campaign to become the 2020 Democratic Nominee for President if he lags in the polls and returns to Montana to run for Senate before the filing deadline. If Bullock returns, it would immediately crush Collins' chances. Bullock is the face of a massive Montana-based fundraising machine, and his statewide recognition and appeal would clear the race. Previous Democratic governor Brian Schweitzer is also considering a bid, who would present an additional formidable challenge to Collins. Schweitzer has been out of politics for nearly a decade, which has been proven to hurt politicians trying to come out of retirement to run for office. Bullock remains the only real threat - and he's reportedly advising his fundraising partners to avoid Collins' campaign and solely focus on getting his Lt. Gov. elected to the Governor's mansion. This indicates that Bullock is trying to keep a backdoor to the Senate open if his presidential ambitions fade. Regardless of the eventual nominee - be it Collins or Bullock, what would a Montanan Democrat have to do to wrest the Senate seat from the Republicans?","Montana's elected an eclectic mix of politicians in the past couple of decades - from progressives, tea party Republicans, libertarian-Republicans, to moderate Democrats. A Democratic hopeful with progressive, populist leanings would need to target the main areas that Clinton performed well in 2016 to solidify their base. Their base: Missoula and Bozeman. Missoula is home to the University of Montana while Bozeman is the location of Montana State University. This is the liberal center of the state and home to 25% or so of potential voters. Old mining towns like Butte and Havre are probably the next best bet - they went for Clinton with 48% of the vote and Bullock with a whopping 67%, Tester with 55%. Collins' advantage? Helena, with its status as the largest swing county in Montana. It has a large state government workforce and tends to lean Democratic, not to mention that it holds 15% of the population. Helena voters wanted Collins as their mayor, so what's to say they won't go for him for Senate? That total gives Collins a shaky 45% of the vote, with his odds in the mining villages and Helena uncertain. His biggest weaknesses are the open counties of Billings and Kalispell at either end of the state - they have a few suburbanites that might be persuaded to vote Democratic, but have often gone for Republicans in statewide elections, as well as rural Montana. Rural Montana is pretty heavily Republican, though there are several Native American tribes like the Blackfeet Nation and Crow Nation that vote Democratic and they have a history of supporting candidates they personally know. Collins' coalition is urban - focusing on maximizing turnout from educated professionals while making inroads to rural areas and voters that might otherwise not vote. Montana makes this simple - it's a small state, population-wise, and voters reward candidates who make an attempt to get to know them. ","Early indicators that Collins is doing well will be large fundraising hauls in the 3rd and 4th quarters, Bullock continuing to plow into the Democratic field until he's thrown out (and missing the filing deadline), and Trump further polarizing the race against his party. Until the preliminary opinion polls come out of Montana voters, there's no way to know how he'll fare against Sen. Daines. Past statewide elections in Montana seem to suggest that a Democrat can win if they stick to a moderate platform, raise enough money to campaign everywhere in the state, are recognizable and familiar to Montanans, and don't try and make the campaign about national issues. In the age of Trump, this might not be enough to tear the state away from its partisan lean - but Collins unique appeal (not to mention that he can never run for President) might be a perfect counterbalance/contrast to the President.

Only time will tell for now - it's a bit too far out to begin making concrete estimates, especially with Bullock being a potential upset. Montana seems to be bucking the national trend of voting solely through partisan lens - if only because they didn't have too many partisans to begin with. One thing's for sure - we'll be waiting for the results till the last minute of November 3rd: Montana takes forever to count their ballots.",,,,,,,,,,How to Win Montana
2,Diversity in American Politics from 2008 to 2019,"Democrats currently hold the mantle of the 'big tent,' multiracial, gender-parity party in the common perception American politics, but does this accurately reflect the realities of the past decade?",/index.html,Noah Caldwell-Gatsos,mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,7/29/19,6:45PM CST,/projects/elections/images/rdebates.jpg,2016 Republican Primary Debates with Donald Trump flanked by Sen. Rubio and Sen. Cruz,Google images,"Especially given the harsh racist rhetoric that's been emanating from President Donald Trump in the past two weeks, it's easy to picture the Democratic Party as the party of diversity. This point is hammered in given the disparity in representation of racial minorities, sexual orientations, and gender in the House, the Democrats have 88 women compared to the Republicans' 13. There is a total of 49 black representatives in the House, but only 1 of them is Republican, and out of 36 Hispanic representatives, only three of them are Republican. Republicans have no representatives of East Asian, South Asian, or Middle Eastern descent (Justin Amash (I-MI) left the party on the 4th of July). No Republican representatives identify as LGBT, while 4 Democrats do. Only two Republican representatives, Lee Zeldin (R-NY) and David Kustoff (R-TN), are Jewish, while 22 Democrats identify as Jewish. Both parties have two representatives of Native American descent, while Democrats have two Muslim women currently serving in Congress. It is easy to put these data into an op ed about the Republicans rapidly becoming the party of White men. But has it always been this way? Prior to Donald Trump's election, Republicans were diversifying at a much slower rate than the Democratic Party, but they had begun to rectify their image as the party of white supremacy. ","In 2013, South Carolina, a former bastion of the KKK and Jim Crow laws - had elected an Indian American female governor, Nikki Haley, who proceeded to appoint a black state legislator, Tim Scott, to the vacant South Carolina senate seat. Sen. Scott remained the only African American Senator in Congress until Cory Booker's election later that year and Kamala Harris' election in 2016. In 2016, the Republicans had a primary where four of the top six competitors consisted of a prominent businesswoman, two Hispanic (of Cuban descent) Senators, and a black neurosurgeon (while the Democrats had no people of color in a primary to succeed the first Black president). At the time, Democrats had only one POC Governor (David Ige of Hawaii), while Republicans had Susana Martinez of New Mexico, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Nikki Haley, Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, and Brian Sandoval of Nevada. That much representation among the Republicans, especially when contrasted with the Democrats', seems like the call of a forgotten era, but was only three years ago. That much changed had happened in a short time as well - almost all of those representatives and executives were elected around the same period (2010-2014). It is strange to imagine the Republicans as the party of Hispanic interests, but these powerful Hispanic and Indian Republican politicians should remind Democrats that they do not have a lock on those voters simply because of one racist President. ","I say this not to excuse the Republican Party's recent racist bent (hi Steve King) and the racist apologizers in Congress protecting the President because of their allegiance to their party and fear of backlash amongst their base. Instead, I want to point attention towards the way that the Democratic Party has been taking people of color for granted since the Clinton Administration. Black and Hispanic voters (of Mexican, Dominican, and Puerto Rican descent) arguably handed Democrats their most essential wins at a presidential level since the Republican Party once again became a dominant force in the country with President Reagan's administration. There is no excuse for the abject indifference the Clinton Campaign ignored people of color in 2016 - which is why she lost. Sure, the Democratic Party had lost the votes of the white working class in the Midwest, but those votes were also heavily dependent on changing demographics and cultural reaction to those demographics. There's only so much political strategy could have done to win those groups over, and I'm not sure I would've liked it if the Party did. But do you know what could be rectified by strategy? Actually targeting and appealing to POC groups scattered throughout the Midwest and the South. Clinton could have chosen a number of prominent Hispanic and black politicians as her running mate, rather than some random white Senator from Virginia. Clinton could have aggressively made appearances in black communities in Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Atlanta rather than just hoping her offhand remark that she carried hot sauce in her purse would encourage them to vote for her. She barely brought up immigration and illegal amnesty at all during the campaign, despite Trump making it a central focus to his. Heck, the Democratic Party could have refused to all but hand Clinton the nomination without a serious primary by refusing to offer endorsements until the primary season started, scheduling proper debates, and tempering internal discussions that Clinton was the presumptive nominee. She had already lost a primary - why should she have been given a second chance in such a way? ","Politicians attempting to run for President in 2020 should take note of galvanizing campaigns in 2018. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams - a popular black legislator - made race a central focus to her campaign for governor and nearly won a state that Democrats hadn't touched in decades. Sen. Doug Jones made overtures to black women the number one priority of his Senate race against Roy Moore in Alabama. Hispanic voters are the reason that there is a Democratic Senator from Arizona. Joe Biden seems to think that his connection to the nation's first black president is reason enough for Black voters to support him - lumping them all in a single group without much regard to unique and varied needs within the group. All black and Hispanic voters do not believe in the same political philosophy and many would appreciate a varied approach like the one granted to white voters of all economic classes. As of July 2019, only two candidates are really making diverse offerings to all racial groups of varying socio-economic interests - Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro. Castro's gone the furthest, offering comprehensive plans to support Native American communities long ignored, Mexican immigrants and their children, working class Black men and women, Hispanic Americans with long histories in their states wanting to see more representation and attention, and established, educated POC professionals facing discriminatory workplace environments who also want to see the same kind of economic change as their white counterparts. ","Donald Trump and his administration, along with the Republicans are not implementing policies for all Americans. Their blatant racism makes them easy targets for Democratic attack ads and messaging. However, it would be a grave mistake for the Democratic party to forget that only three years ago, it seemed like Republicans had a firm foundation from which to challenge their presumed dominance over Hispanic votes. Trump is certainly not someone who we would like to continue to see in the Oval Office in 2021 and getting over taking POC votes as something for granted is essential to remove the man from Washington. Democrats need to take note from Justice Democrats, Black Lives Matter, and the varying progressive think tanks attempting to redefine policies towards race and make it a centerpiece of their campaigns. They need to aggressively campaign for election reform - ensuring that every American, regardless of socio-economic status is able to easily vote, they need to rectify the grave injustices that have been perpetrated against POC of lower socio-economic classes under the guise of a 'war on drugs' and their subsequent imprisonment and disenfranchisement, and they need to offer comprehensive immigration reform messaging - it is not enough to offer substantial policies - it is necessary to convince the American public why these are necessary. Candidates who follow that narrow playbook and continue to find innovative ways to solve the myriad issues facing communities of color while listening to their concerns will be the most successful in 2020 and the decades beyond. Democrats cannot allow Republicans to continue racist policies with POC support simply because of their indifference. They need to properly understand race and how modern Americans view it, and weaponize it.

3,Warren's Going to Dominate the Second Democratic Debates.,"On a stage with five moderates who'll attack Sanders the first night and her two rivals destroying each other the second, Warren's going to rise above it all.",/index.html,Noah Caldwell-Gatsos,mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,7/30/19,12:00AM CST,/projects/elections/images/ddebates.jpg,,Google Images,This is the last chance for many of the Democratic candidates polling at 1% to really make an impact to qualify for the September debates. They couldn't have asked for a better hand. All the moderates were given the perfect targets: progressive frontrunners Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders the first night. All the progressives were given the moderate frontrunners Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the second. You can bet that they're going to be in attack mode. ,"Harris is probably in the worst position this time around - which would make an impressive performance even more extraordinary if she manages to pull it off. She just released her first, real proposal for healthcare - and has already been pummeled by the left and right. Biden will be much more prepared for a race-based onslaught on Wednesday, and Kamala won't have that lane to herself with all of the candidates of color unfortunately grouped together on the same night. She won't even be able to benefit from a potential tag team support like Warren and Sanders will the first night, she's spent so much time trying to define a lane for herself that she'll be alone. Wednesday will be the night that we might see Harris fall and Booker or Castro finally rise. Or Kamala will prove beyond a doubt that she's the perfect person to take on Trump by outflanking all her rivals and playing a bad hand masterfully. It remains to be seen.","But by continuing to separate Warren and Harris in the only real events that matter this far ahead of the Iowa primaries, the media have all but ensured one, or both of their rise. Warren and Harris essentially have the same voters - surprising many and overturning the attempted media spin that Warren and Sanders are in the same lane. Analytics venues like FiveThirtyEight have proven that most Biden supporters consider Bernie their second choice, and vice versa. The same goes for Warren and Harris, for whatever odd reason (neither pairing has remotely similar policies). By keeping the pairs separate, the media has prevented those voters from contrasting the candidates that the data says they want to contrast and almost forcing the media narrative of Biden vs Harris and Warren vs Bernie down our throats. Because there's only a limited number of events like these and their actual tangible effect on public perception, it ensures that the eventual frontrunner matchup will be one of those later two pairs, instead of the one that voters actually want. ","I believe the final matchup in September and beyond will be Warren vs Biden. Sanders really overestimated how much of his 2016 support was really just a protest vote against Clinton, and for someone with nearly 100% name recognition he's polling horribly. Party activists have continually placed him at the top of lists of who they don't want to see as the nominee, he has a horrible relationship with the media (meaning he'll get less favorable coverage and continue to be framed as the 'annoying candidate'), he often goes off script and does his own thing in contrast to what his policy directors tell him, and his fundraising has been lackluster in comparison to the rest of the field. Like I mentioned above, unless Kamala really does a great job in Wednesday's debate, I think she'll be the top target instead of Biden. Her polling bump's already gone down since the June debates and she hasn't managed to recreate the durable rise that Warren's perfected.","Which brings us back to the first premise - Warren's going to shine again in tomorrow's debate. The last thing the moderates want is to be made to look like an idiot on stage - precisely why Warren dominated the first time around. Nobody wanted to give her room to prove them wrong. Just see poor Tim Ryan in the last debate - he was annihilated by Tulsi Gabbard and got mocked all over the internet. You don't attack someone on their own turf - and Warren's the policy master on everything. All she wants is someone to give her a platform to prove them wrong - that's her whole brand. But it's not Bernie's. Bernie thrived off his energy, his massive promises, and incomplete policies designed to spark inspiration and hope instead of confidence. He's the perfect target for these wonky moderates. Sure, he'll have Warren helping him - everytime he stumbles will be more ways for her to get speaking time in - but while he's fending off personal attacks, Warren's help is going to come off as the teacher helping the clumsy student. He's stuck between a rock and a hard place and it'd be shocking if he can extract himself from it.",Democrats,Primaries,2020,President,https://www.salon.com/2019/07/29/are-democrats-ready-to-fight-the-signs-arent-promising-this-weeks-debates-are-crucial/,Are Democrats ready to fight?

She's currently polling at 15% nationwide (tie w/ Sanders for 2nd), 15% in Iowa (tie w/ Harris for 2nd), and 18% in New Hampshire (2nd). I don't think these debates will push her past Biden - yet - but I think it will solidify her in second place only a few points behind him. From readings, post debate bumps seem to have diminishing returns the higher polling a candidate is (i.e. Harris pre-June debates was polling around 8%, Harris doubled her share and is currently polling between 12-16%, while Warren pre-debates was polling around 12-14% and is currently polling around 15-17%). Due to this estimate there won't be a massive shift in support, but I think that she will receive a boost of 3% across the board. In National, Iowa, and New Hampshire polls she will gain at the expense of Biden, Harris, and Sanders, all of whom I predict will suffer in this debate. Biden and Warren will stay fairly neck and neck for the remainder of the Summer - Biden ahead by 8 points Nationally with 27% support, 3-4 points ahead with 21% support in Iowa, and 21% in NH. Warren won't surpass Biden until their debate in September - the first time they both will be on stage. That will make for some fireworks - Warren has been an antagonist of Biden long before she became a Senator and national figure. Biden, as the Wall Street-loving Delaware corporate enabler, represents everything Warren has spent her life fighting against. He'll be an appetizer before she eviscerates Trump.

4,Elizabeth Warren is the Democratic Ronald Reagan,The question is whether or not she can mobilize the Democrats to such a landslide victory that she redefines American politics for a generation. ,/index.html,Noah Caldwell-Gatsos,mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com,7/30/19,11:42PM  CST,/projects/elections/images/warrenreagan.jpg,President Reagan and Sen. Warren,Google Images,"Something Nate Silver on FiveThirtyEight mentioned <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-midsummer-overview-of-the-democratic-field/"">the other day</a> was intriguing:","Warren is offering more red meat (or should it be blue meat?) and would represent more of a leftward transformation from the status quo, she's <a href=https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/moderate-democrats-surprising-embrace-of-eli zabeth-warren-at-the-democratic-debate""> simpatico enough with the party elite </a>and has <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-elizabeth-warren-could-win-the-2020-democratic-primary/ ""> broad enough appeal </a>that she isn't necessarily a factional candidate in the way that Sanders is. Instead, a better analogy for Warren might be Ronald Reagan; they are not comparable in terms of their backgrounds or their political styles, but they are both candidates who straddle the boundary between the ideological wings of their party and the party establishment.""","Silver goes on to emphasize that Warren's strategy is the path less taken in American politics. Biden's 'next in line' lane (HW Bush, Mondale, Gore, Kerry, Hillary Clinton) and Harris's 'coalition-builder' lane (Bill Clinton, Obama) have produced more recent winners than Warren's - though I'd argue that a 'next-in-line' strategy hasn't worked for decades to elect a winner who would go on to win the Presidency. All three are polling reasonably well at the moment, so Silver concludes that they're all in the top three of his choices to win the Primary. So let's go to my main premise - Warren is the Democratic reincarnation of Ronald Reagan. How did Reagan win the 1980 Primaries to go on to fight President Carter?","Reagan initially lost his first and second nomination attempts to represent the Republicans in 1968 and 1976 versus former Vice President Richard Nixon and later incumbent President Gerald Ford. He was obviously successful on his third try, beating his rival, the former Director of the CIA, H.W. Bush of Texas. The 1980 Republican Primary was nowhere near as crowded as the 2020 Democratic Primary is now, but H.W. Bush was thought of as the establishment candidate. He was the head of the Republican National Committee and had already served in a previous Republican President's cabinet. Even so, Reagan was widely considered the early favorite to win the nomination because he was so far ahead in the polls. Reagan lost Iowa to Bush but won in New Hampshire. Reagan went on to sweep the South, win California, and became the Republican nominee without much fanfare or contested conventions. ","Obviously, there are many dissonances between Reagan's fate and Warren's future. She is not the current frontrunner, though I'd counter that by saying that Democrats initially prefer establishment candidates and continued governance until a new candidate captures public attention (i.e. Hillary Clinton vs. Obama), while Republicans' brand is that they like disestablishment candidates and are much more likely to support an outsider. Biden's early lead isn't something to ignore, but it is something to take with a grain of salt. Clinton ran ahead of Obama by more than 20 points for much of 2007. I predict that Biden or Harris will win Iowa, but Warren will win New Hampshire - similar to 1980. The biggest issue for Warren will be the South. It is easy for a Republican candidate to win both New Hampshire and South Carolina - they're essentially the same constituencies. It is harder for a Democratic candidate to do the same. Winning Iowa would be a better indicator of success in the South for a Democrat, as seen from Obama's example in 2008. To sweep the South, Warren would need to spectacularly raise her profile among black voters, which dominate the Democratic primaries. There is a big interest among black voters to be seen as a diverse block with varying interests. Older individuals want Joe Biden - who they see as carrying Obama's legacy and supported  by their chosen leaders in Congress. Younger members see themselves in Kamala Harris and see her as someone who shares their same experiences. Warren's path to victory? Winning over those who want more than just vague promises and nostalgia, but a working plan for the future that addresses their unique issues and inspires confidence. If Warren gets that part of her strategy down pat, she'll be on track towards inheriting Reagan's success. Otherwise, it is likely that the nomination will be hard for any candidate as Biden dominates the heartland, Harris the South and California, and Warren everywhere else. Biden or Harris faltering earlier than expected would also propel Warren to the nomination faster.

For the record, Obama had <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Democratic_Party_presidential_candidates"">no significant primary challengers </a> in 2012. Carter had a wild foreign environment in 1980, facing disastrous results from his handling of the Iran Contra Affair that threatened his mandate. Trump hasn't had one particular incident that bad yet - but Americans largely believe he's done <a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-america/2019-06-26/who-says-foreign-policy-doesnt-win-elections"">an awful job </a>managing international affairs. ","Could there be Warren-Republicans the same way that there were Reagan-Democrats? This - above anything - will be the marker of a true shift in American politics. Reagan was only able to become a successful President because his landslide victory against Carter (489 vs. 49 electoral votes) handed Republicans such a powerful electoral mandate. With this victory came a sea change of +12 Republican seats in the Senate, giving the Republicans control of the upper chamber and full control of the Executive Branch's main functions (the Senate, through their ability to approve Executive and Judicial nominees and their role as the main legislative branch's main conduit for Foreign Policy arguably exerts a significant role over Executive power). A President Warren would need a comfortable majority around the size of the Republican's current hold (i.e. 53 to 47 seats) to effect a lot of her proposed policy changes. Maintaining control of the House would also go a long way towards avoiding Republican obstructionism. ","This observation bares almost no statistical significance to Warren's eventual performance against Trump, but it's worth noting that in the 1980 Election matchup between incumbent President Carter and Ronald Reagan, he won his challenge. Carter was a vastly unpopular first term President, party activists were itching for a larger role in the electoral process after eight years of Nixon & Ford's tepid Conservative leadership, and the economy had just experienced a big shock under a decade previously. America's too young and these presidential contests have too many variables to really create sustainable trends - but for the sake of a fun hypothetical, Reagan and Warren share many similarities.",,,,,,,,Elizabeth Warren is the Democratic Ronald Reagan

Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada Speaking ,Google Images,"Choosing a Vice President is one of the most helpful insights into what a Presidential candidate views as their major weakness. In 2000, Bush was a political newcomer lacking extensive ties with the establishment - Dick Cheney embodied the establishment. In 2004, John Kerry was viewed as an out-of-touch liberal elder statesman from Massachusetts, so he picked a down-to-earth, young Senator from North Carolina as his running mate. In 2008, the Obama Campaign was worried that he might be seen as too radical, so they went with the most non-offensive selection they could find: tenured Senator Joe Biden. For all of their failings, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska and Rep. Paul Ryan represented fresh, new faces for the Republican Party and neatly contrasted with John McCain and Mitt Romney. God only knows what Secretary Clinton’s campaign was thinking in 2016 with Sen. Tim Kaine - perhaps something similar to what the Obama campaign considered, but it clearly wasn’t the right move. Trump didn’t have too many options coming his way towards the end of the 2016 Election, but Gov. Mike Pence - a religious Governor from the heartland, paired well with a flamboyant, vice-prone New Yorker. Vice Presidents can rectify any electoral failings in a presidential campaign, but they often have influence far beyond what the media paints them as. ","Here are the major factors at play in a VP selection (a summary from FiveThirtyEight’s Guide to Veep Selection):  <ul>
<li><b>Geography</b>: Candidates choose their VP’s from large, Electorally beneficial states on the opposite end of the country from their base. </li>
<li><b>Ideology</b>: Candidates choose VP’s that increase their appeal to the entire party. A more moderate candidate chooses a liberal VP. A more liberal candidate will choose a moderate.</li>
<li><b>Race</b>: Especially for the Democratic Party, which is much more of a big tent than the Republicans, having a diverse ticket is increasingly becoming the norm.</li>
<li><b>Gender</b>: Even though there isn’t a lot of statistical evidence to show that having a woman on the ticket improves traction with female voters, that might change in the #MeToo era.</li>
<li><b>Religion</b>: Not really a big deal for Democrats, essential for Republicans without major appeal to evangelicals and Baptists.</b>
<li><b>Resume</b>: Perhaps the most important category in this list, governing experience is the single best predictor of someone’s eligibility for Vice President. If the running candidate is seen as experienced, then this might be less of a factor, but if they’re a newbie, having someone with the connections to get maximum party support is essential.</b>","That brings us to the candidates. It’s happily just a series of binary classifications on the twenty or so candidates that I’m drawing from. I have a list of rising stars in the party that have more than 5+ years of experience (i.e. no Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or the Squad members) and have generated interest on several news sites already, in addition to the field of Primary candidates polling below 2% in the primaries. ","<b>For Senator Elizabeth Warren</b> (D-MA): Warren’s difficult, mostly because there’s only been one other woman on the top of a party ticket to use as an example. If she wins the nomination, she’ll likely choose someone who is 1) male, 2) moderate, 3) of color, 4) and from a large state to balance out her own characteristics. The obvious option would be <b>Secretary Castro of Texas</b>. He’s polling at below 2% in the primary, doesn’t face good electoral prospects back home, and was even already vetted as a Vice Presidential candidate for Clinton. Arguably, he might have had the potential to compensate for Clinton’s unpopularity with some minority voters. Castro doesn’t have a long resume or isn’t that ideologically far from Warren, but he has other characteristics that make him appealing. I might be wrong - Warren’s enough of a firebrand and risk taker that she might buck the system for what she feels is right. She’s not Clinton, and she’s probably learned a lesson or two from 2016. If she feels comfortable enough with another woman on the ticket, she might go with a prominent woman of color from the House or the South. ","<b>For Vice President Joe Biden</b> (D-DE): Biden’s easier, because he fits in the mold of all the other candidates in the past and he’s been pretty open about who he envisions as his VP (Hi Kamala Harris). With their newfound rivalry from the debate stage, I think it would be nearly impossible for him to pick her now - nor do I think she’d be into the idea. She’s been pretty hostile to it already, and can camp out in the California Senate seat she has until 2022. He’s probably already burned bridges with Stacey Abrams because of his gaffe at the beginning of his campaign where his team reportedly reached out to her to see if they could head off the rest of the field early. Going forward, he has a couple other options. He’s publicly said he’s interested in a woman as his running mate. He’s got enough of a lead with black voters that he might not need a black VP, but there are other areas he fares poorly in. I’m thinking of Nevada primarily. It looks like Nevada will be Warren territory in the early primaries - meaning Biden is suffering with Latinx voters. The best way to fix this? <b>Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada</b>. She’s a political blank slate - not too moderate, nor too progressive. She already has a leadership position in the Senate despite being in her first term. She represents a mild swing state in Nevada, and is at the opposite end of the country from the Delaware/Pennsylvania block Biden’s trying to emulate. Other options could very well be Stacey Abrams (who would be out of office for a full four years until the GA Governor’s race opens again) or <b>Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois</b>. She’s young, Asian American, from the heartland, a veteran, and lost both of her legs in the Iraq War. She’s been mentioned as a potential running mate and even eventual Presidential contender by many. But, she just had a kid, which would make her unlikely to pursue a high-profile presidential race.

Bernie Sanders</b> (I-VT): Bernie’s the hardest to nail down, simply because he’s such a loose cannon. He’d likely buck the idea of choosing a moderate and just go with his gut (i.e. he’s going to pick someone who’s already in his inner circle). What would be a fascinating pick for Bernie would be <b>San Juan Mayor Carmen Cruz of Puerto Rico</b>. She’s a member of his campaign advisors, young-ish, and represents a lot of what he doesn’t. She’s also extremely far left, which he might find appealing. The prospect of a potential Puerto Rican presidential ticket candidate is extremely interesting, but she’s also running in the 2020 election for Governor right now. Other options from Bernie’s inner circle would be <b>Rep. Ro Khanna of California</b> or one of his rivals who endorsed him in 2016 like<b>Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii</b>. None of this really follows the statistics that I mentioned above, but Bernie’s an unconventional candidate and really reminds me of the crony-politics I’ve witnessed in Latin American populists. He won’t want to temper his campaign by bringing in a moderate, he’ll want someone who’s just as passionate as he is. ","<b>For Sen. Kamala Harris</b> (D-CA): Harris is also a tough one, despite her plethora of options. She has a foot in almost every door in the Democratic Primary, so needing a more moderate or liberal running mate isn’t an issue. She’s from California, so I see her picking a young-ish white male from the heartland as her running mate. The most obvious choice is <b>Beto O’Rourke of Texas</b>. He rectifies a lot of her issues, and the ideology of the campaign would be vaguely leftist-center. Pete Buttigeig could also be an option, but the whole ticket would be <i>very inexperienced<i>. Harris has a bit of a claim to governance, she’s been in politics for nearly two decades now, but only in a major statewide position for eight. It would violate a lot of the rules that we’ve put in place to determine her running mate. In all honesty, I see her picking a more established name with a better track record than one of her rivals. <b>Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio</b> is the best choice I think. He’s a populist with a track record of winning red states, he’s white, male, and would appeal to everyone that Harris doesn’t. At the same time, Brown’s already been discussed as a potential running mate and avoided because of one major reason: having him on the ticket would probably hand the Republicans the Senate for the next six years. He just won reelection easily in Ohio in 2018, despite the state’s increasingly red hue in recent years - in the same year Ohio elected a Republican Governor. If he becomes VP, Brown’s seat will go to the Republicans until a special election is held in 2022, where it will likely be won by a Republican. The Democrats can’t really afford to lose any of their swing state votes - especially Brown, who’s managed to hang on and still be super liberal. That leaves Harris in a continued bind - who would she pick? Luckily, she’s in the inverse situation that white male candidates like the B’s are facing. The sky’s the limit when it comes to trying to find a moderate white male candidate in America.","<b>For Mayor Pete Buttigeig</b> (D-IN): Finally, Buttigeig is an intriguing case study. He’s like Harris in a lot of ways - he’s the inverse of the majority of the field (which is probably the source of his popularity) and gay. That’s significant, but with his history of racial injustice during his stint as South Bend’s mayor, I can’t see him picking anyone besides a black running mate from the coasts. Like Harris, he has a foot in every lane - so it doesn’t really matter what ideology he chooses - but the single most important feature for him is experience. He needs someone to balance out the worries that he’s too inexperienced to be president. So who’s an experienced, black legislator or executive? He honestly doesn’t have a lot of options. We have a real problem with nominating black individuals to prominent statewide positions in the country - there are only two black Democratic Senators (and both are running for President), and both are relatively new. Booker or Harris could be the ideal pairing for him, but Harris’s history with criminal justice might turn a lot of black voters off (especially if Buttigeig becomes the nominee, because that means black voters liked a gay white man from Indiana over the first black female nominee for President). Booker is more of a possibility, but he’s also disliked by a lot of the black electorate which is Buttigeig’s biggest problem area. An interesting idea would be <b>Shadow Senator Jesse Jackson of Washington D.C.</b>, but he’s been a fringe actor in national politics for ages. Other options would be one of the leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus in the House. Someone like <b> Chair Rep. Karen Bass of California</b> or <b>Yvette Clarke</b>, or <b>Cedric Richmond of Louisiana</b>. I have a feeling that Buttigeig would try and appeal to one of those powerful lawmakers to legitimize his campaign. ","I left off quite a few people here - mostly white, straight men from battlegrounds because they don’t fit the profile. Gov. Steve Bullock, Sen. Michael Bennett, or Gov. John Hickenlooper all fit that ‘bland-Tim-Kaine-profile’ but I don’t think candidates are interested in that this time around. A couple of other intriguing options would be Alabama Senator Doug Jones - but that would mean giving up the Alabama Senate Seat when it looks like he actually might win again - Governor Gavin Newsom of California - he’s been pretty blatant about his presidential ambitions - and Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin, the only LGBT Senator in history. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico could also be an intriguing option, but he’s running for the open Senate seat in 2020. I also left off a lot of prominent women of color like Rep. Deb Haaland of New Mexico or Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts because they’re really, really new. Give them a few years in office and they’ll be ideal Presidential candidates, let alone Vice President. Experience is still the number one indicator of who people will choose as VP. ","I’d be interested to know if I missed anybody, so shoot me an email or leave a comment and I’ll look into it!",,,,,,
6,Many Progressive Senate Candidates Have a History of Losing Primaries - Here's How To Change That ," The Intercept supports a variety of progressive candidates in 2020, but their choices seem to have little appeal to the states they run in. ", /index.html, Noah Caldwell-Gatsos, mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com, @ Noah, 8/16/19, 1:30PM CST, /projects/elections/images/bp6front.jpg, Kerri Harris of Delaware Lost Her Primary Against Sen. Carper, From: <a href='https://theintercept.com/'>The Intercept</a>," Don't get me wrong - I love publications like The Intercept, and every single one of the candidates they‚Äôve mentioned in their recent <a href=‚Äúhttps://theintercept.com/2019/08/15/senate-democrats-2020-chuck-schumer/‚Äù>post</a> about the progressive energy going into the 2020 Democratic Primaries. In particular, State Sen. <a href=‚Äúhttps://ericaforus.com/platforms-and-priorities‚Äù>Erica Smith</a> of my home state North Carolina, is really inspirational and seems like a deviation from the consultant-heavy, white, bland candidate that Democrats have been running in North Carolina for decades now. Sen. Kay Hagan was great - but trying to run her <a href=‚Äúhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_United_States_Senate_election_in_North_Carolina‚Äù>doppelg√§nger</a> for the <a href=‚Äúhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_Senate_election_in_North_Carolina‚Äù>past</a> <a href=‚Äúhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_Senate_election_in_North_Carolina‚Äù>three</a> elections isn‚Äôt a good look. That‚Äôs just one case - each of these states are very different, and each has the potential to nominate one of these wonderful progressives. However, I have a theory why they won‚Äôt, and haven‚Äôt ever, caught the imaginations of primary voters up until this point. I want to build on this theory with specific case studies below - and finish with a major point about how to revitalize the Democratic majority in the Senate. "," Wilmot Collins of Montana probably has the longest shot of becoming the nominee. I've covered that in another <a href='projects/elections/posts/elections_bp1.html'>post</a> on here, but he suffers from Montana's demographics. Not racial - I'm a firm believer that people in the U.S. really don‚Äôt consider race as a major factor behind their electoral choices - but socio-economic. Montana has no urban centers. For better or worse, Democrats‚Äô political theory in the last decade has focused on policies that stem from <a href=‚Äúhttps://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/05/22/urban-suburban-and-rural-residents-views-on-key-social-and-political-issues/‚Äú>experiences</a> living in dense metro areas. Socialism is derived from living in close contact with a variety of diverse individuals (in thought as well as ethno-national origin) and depending on community goods to prosper, while rural living emphasizes self-reliance and homogeneity. Like I covered in my Collins‚Äô post, Montana just doesn‚Äôt have the urban-community mindset needed to empathize with a progressive like Collins. Add that to the fact that  a financial powerhouse candidate might drop out of the Presidential race at any time and Collins‚Äô chances look slim. "," The view that only moderates have a chance in red areas have encouraged Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to pursue the blandest set of candidates he can find. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Steve Bullock of Montana, MJ Hegar of Texas, Teresa Tomlinson of Georgia, Katie McGrath of Kentucky, Cal Cunningham of North Carolina, Theresa Greenfield of Iowa, and Jaime Harrison of South Carolina are all pretty‚Ä¶boring. They‚Äôre relatively uninspiring candidates (nearly all of whom have a track record of losing a prior race), and his nationwide strategy seems to be getting a substantial enough threat to the Republican incumbents that forces the national party to divert their funds to those races without any real intent to win. This has already backfired in Kentucky, where Katie McGrath imploded shortly after declaring her candidacy. ","The story changes in Texas. Progressive organizer Cristina Ramirez might have a chance. She‚Äôs inherited Beto‚Äôs strategy and team from 2018, he‚Äôs publicly rejected any chance of coming back to Texas to run for Senate again, and she has demographics on her side (Hispanics now form the minority-majority in Texas, and the rural areas are declining while the major urban areas are booming). Ramirez‚Äôs strategy is starkly different from Hegar‚Äôs, reflecting a trend in the 2020 Democratic Senate primaries. Like Cunningham vs. Smith in NC, McGrath vs. Jones in KY, Hickenlooper vs. Johnston in CO, and Bullock vs. Collins in MT - there is a narrative of the bland, establishment candidate running a moderate campaign against the inspirational, risk-taking progressives forming in the 2020 races. "," I wish I could say unequivocally that the progressive is <b>the</b> choice for 2020. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema ran an unapologetically moderate campaign to win Arizona in 2018 (despite being openly bisexual and progressive in the past) and Mark Kelly seems poised to win with that strategy in 2020.  Progressive women haven‚Äôt made much of a dent in North Carolina since Senator Hagan‚Äôs first and only win in 2008. Delaware voters had no appetite for insurgent Kerri Harris‚Äôs leftist primary challenge to Sen. Tom Carper in 2018. Compared to the diverse, female-led Democratic House, the U.S. Senate is an inhospitable place for diversity of race, gender, and thought. In the 116th Congress, there are 91 white senators compared to 9 of color. There are only 24 women. Electability is a <a href=‚Äúhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/15/18525308/electability-women-candidates-2020-elizabeth-warren-kamala-harris-amy-klobuchar-kirsten-gillibrand‚Äù>miserable</a> way to evaluate potential candidates, but statistically it‚Äôs unlikely the makeup of the Senate will change immensely. Not only does the structural organization of the Senate (favoring small, majority white, rural states) mean that most of the makeup is likely just a result of demographics (if there‚Äôs more white people, there‚Äôs more white candidates), but even in states where ethnic groups are distributed more equally (like the Bible Belt), white Republicans have a stranglehold on statewide politics. The only Republican Black Senator, Tim Scott, was initially an appointee that was nominated by the first POC Governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley. There‚Äôs plenty of evidence that once a POC is in a position of power, concerns about their ‚Äòelectability‚Äô vanish - but they have to get there somehow first.", Senate,2020, Progressive, Strategy, https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/440331-senate-buzzsaw-awaits-2020-progressive-proposals, Senate Buzzsaw Awaits 2020 Progressive Proposals, https://www.apnews.com/3c2a32d024a34f178a85d9dc0fc13ae0," In Key Races, Democrats Buck Leftward Tilt on Issues", https://www.vox.com/2018/11/7/18071700/progressive-democrats-house-midterm-elections-2018, Progressive Democrats running in competitive House districts had a bad night on Tuesday," All of this post sounded super negative and pessimistic, but there‚Äôs something unique about each of these candidates and 2020 that started with the Georgia race for Governor in 2018 with Stacey Abrams. These progressive candidates aren‚Äôt trying to win over Republicans that voted for Trump in 2016. These candidates are trying to cultivate completely new voter bases that never voted in previous elections. This has potentially game-changing effects for the elections of the 20s. Trump won in 2016 because he managed to inspire turnout from folks who had never voted before, while Clinton lost in 2016 because she depressed turnout from folks who had. I don‚Äôt want to agree with the popular narrative that rural, red states are going through major demographic shifts - none of the growing populations in states like Montana, Kentucky, Tennessee, or Mississippi are large enough to form a dominant electorate. I want to argue in favor of a uniquely American phenomenon. There are a large number of states in the U.S. are starkly Urban-Rural, meaning that they have wide swaths of rural land while their population is concentrated in a single regional, massive urban center. Just look at the traditional blue states of New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Each of these states has two or more statewide elected officials who are Democrats because their rural land is anchored by a major metropolitan area (New York City, Philadelphia/Pittsburgh, Chicago, St.Paul/Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Detroit). Now - think about it. There are a significant number of ‚Äòred states‚Äô that also have this phenomenon. Georgia with Atlanta, Florida with Miami, North Carolina with Charlotte, and Ohio with Cleveland. Heck, Texas with their four major metro areas could be compared to California. The reason that these states have trended red in recent years is because their major metros are dying. All the wealth is being concentrated in the costal finance capitals. If Democrats want to retake their governing advantage, they need to revitalize these urban centers. Just think about it - Democrats have been able to retake a chamber of Congress and possess a majority in the Senate for half of the last decade WITH a structural disadvantage in the government. Imagine what would happen if you removed that handicap. Democrats need to spend the 20s focusing on revitalizing these forgotten regional capitals, and taking power away from the Coasts. If they do that, the Senate‚Äôs modern paralysis will end. ", ,,,,,,,,,

8,"The Monmouth Poll Was Satisfying, But Probably Inaccurate"," It‚Äôs great seeing the candidates you want to win succeeding, but always take polls at this stage in the race with a grain of salt.", /index.html, Noah Caldwell-Gatsos, mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com, @ Noah, 8/27/19, 3:11 PM CST, /projects/elections/images/bp8front.jpeg, Polling‚Äôs often much more confusing than it seems., by Elliot Stallion @ Unsplash.com," Yesterday morning, political pundits were abuzz with the news that Biden‚Äôs polling lead had finally vanished. Biden, Warren, and Sanders were now pretty much tied to win the nomination, each possessing nearly 20% of the vote. On its face, this was great news. Monmouth‚Äôs not some fringe pollster, they have an <a href=‚Äúhttps://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/?ex_cid=irpromo‚Äù>A+ rating from FiveThirtyEight</a>. Don‚Äôt fall for the confirmation bias. One poll like this is more likely to be just a single outlying data point rather than a signal of a growing trend. This is especially true when you look at the Emerson Poll released this morning, showing Biden right back up and Warren/Sanders in the positions they were in all summer. So what was wrong? Wasn‚Äôt Monmouth one of the DNCs, FiveThirtyEight, and Real Clear Politics‚Äô approved pollsters? "," Why can‚Äôt we rely on really good pollsters to be accurate? Just because a pollster has experience and has performed well in the past isn‚Äôt enough. Various factors involved in the actual methodology of polling impacts the reliability of a poll. One of these factors is sample size. Like Rachel Bitecofer of the Wason Center in Virginia <a href=‚Äúhttps://twitter.com/RachelBitecofer/status/1166130790629031939‚Äù>emphasized on Twitter this morning</a>, there were just 298 people referenced in the poll. For context, other polls taken around this time involve thousands of people. Even the best pollster can‚Äôt get a truly representative sample with only a couple hundred answerers, and Monmouth continued to break down the results into subcategories like age group with little more than 10 to 12 people responding. The margin-of-error of nearly 5.7% was also troubling. That‚Äôs a big difference. For reference, even among the distorted representation polled by Monmouth, that could mean that Warren and Sanders only got 14% of the vote (closer to where they stand in poll aggregates) and Biden got 25% (closer to where he stands in poll aggregates). That‚Äôs an extreme example, but it gives cause for warning. "," Ok, so I can‚Äôt rely on professional pollsters to give me a good view of who‚Äôs winning. Are there any other ways to tell? The short answer is that polling really sucks this far out and we really shouldn‚Äôt be trying to analyze the horse race. The media tends to treat these primaries like football drafts, which is unfortunate because there‚Äôs a variety of actually meaningful stats that impact drafts while there‚Äôs almost no established factors that have a high degree of impacting the primaries. History shows that polls taken <a href=‚Äúhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-we-take-these-early-general-election-polls-seriously-no/‚Äù>further than two months out before the election</a> aren‚Äôt accurate. The annoying, but real answer is that the only thing these polls are picking up on is name recognition. The media reports that Pete Buttigeig and Elizabeth Warren aren‚Äôt doing well with black voters, but that‚Äôs <a href=‚Äúhttps://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/2019/08/08-buttigieg-favorability/‚Äù>actually just because black voters have no idea who these people are</a>. That‚Äôs really the cause of the ‚Äòso-called‚Äô black focus on electability. Black voters are diverse and don‚Äôt share the same political beliefs. What the mainstream media‚Äôs trying to push is the narrative that Black voters always vote for the safest choice, using Obama not  catching fire until he proved he could win Iowa as a example. But this is the wrong way of thinking about this phenomenon that ties into how we‚Äôre so focused on polling at this early stage. Obama got the support of black voters, AND white voters in South Carolina after he won Iowa because they had heard of him! That‚Äôs just one example of media distortion based on polling, but the whole environment is a confusing mess and shouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously at this stage. ","Fine. We can‚Äôt rely on polls. Is there anything I can use to evaluate who has the best chance of winning? Absolutely! A lot of FiveThirtyEight‚Äôs staff has recently tried to establish a couple factors to be able to tell who‚Äôs doing the best in the race so far. Before I go into them, it‚Äôs important to decide <b>why you want to look at the candidates this way in the first place</b>. Are you trying to use this to decide who to vote for? Because voting for a primary candidate <a href=‚Äúhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/15/18525308/electability-women-candidates-2020-elizabeth-warren-kamala-harris-amy-klobuchar-kirsten-gillibrand‚Äù>based on their perceived electability is a recipe for disaster</a>. Just vote for the candidate that shares your positions! It‚Äôs the primary, that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre there for! Don‚Äôt worry about what everybody else wants to vote for. That‚Äôs how we end up with unrepresentative candidates running for President and it‚Äôs the reason everyone‚Äôs uncomfortable with the idea of ‚Äòinvisible primaries‚Äô where the Democratic and Republican elites just select the candidate they want. However, if your desire to predict who might win is from a scholarly perspective, there are a couple of indicators you can use to get a sense of who‚Äôs got enough staying power to remain in the race for as long as possible. After all, a candidate actually being in the race is the strongest correlate to winning votes. "," I briefly go through an overview of the candidates‚Äô campaign organizations <a href=‚Äúhttp://ncaldwellgatsos.com/projects/elections/posts/elections_bp7.html‚Äù>here</a>, but in this post I‚Äôd like to go over some extraneous factors that FiveThirtyEight and other data-driven  resources are looking at when they evaluate the staying power of the candidates. The first is favorability ratings. These are useful because, as FiveThirtyEight‚Äôs Nathaniel Rakich <a href=‚Äúhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/after-two-debates-warren-is-getting-more-popular/‚Äù>has found</a>, it captures the reality that primary voters are comparing and contrasting several options for president, not just one. At the moment, Warren, Sanders, and Biden are roughly tied in their favorability ratings. The next feature is the number of activists that are excited about their candidacy. FiveThirtyEight‚Äôs Seth Masket has been running a project where he <a href=‚Äúhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-early-state-activists-are-uncommitted-but-they-think-warren-is-gaining-ground/‚Äù>interviews Democratic activists</a> in early primary states. As of his most recent installment, it seems as though the most energy is concentrated around Harris, Buttigeig, Biden, and Warren. A third factor involved is the number of mentions that each candidate has in the news. FiveThirtyEight‚Äôs Dhrumil Mehta‚Äôs been examining these statistics, and in <a href=‚Äúhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-democratic-presidential-candidate-was-mentioned-most-in-the-news-last-week-7/‚Äù>his most recent report</a>, he found that while Biden‚Äôs dominated the cable news mentions through the summer, Sanders and Warren have forced him to share the spotlight. The final external element to consider is who is getting the most endorsements from people within the party. This falls back into the ‚Äòinvisible Primary‚Äô trope that always surrounds Presidential Primaries, which is ironic when you consider that almost every other nation on the planet is governed exclusively by people with ironclad establishment ties. This is the hardest metric to use, because the field is so large. None of the biggest players (we don‚Äôt see you Obama) have ventured out in support of a single candidate yet. Most Democratic leaders, like their Republican counterparts in 2016‚Äôs crowded race, are adopting a wait-and-see approach. However,  Democrats have proven to be much more willing to endorse someone else from their home state. Harris, Warren, Booker, and Klobuchar have all gotten big legs up from establishment players from Senators to former Vice Presidents who come from their home states. However, Biden‚Äôs really the only candidate to garner widespread establishment appeal from outside his geographic base (which should surprise absolutely nobody). ", Primaries, Predictions, Polls, Horserace, https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/26/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-joe-biden-poll-1475440," Poll: Bernie, Warren Surge to Tie Biden Atop the Democratic Field ", https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/2019/07/01-2020-election-forecast/," With 16 Months to Go, Negative Partisanship Predicts the 2020 Presidential Election", http://ncaldwellgatsos.com/projects/elections/posts/elections_bp7.html, A Look Inside the 2020 Democratic Campaigns for President ," None of these is the final word on anything. As Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight has <a href=‚Äúhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/joe-biden-has-an-iowa-problem-not-an-enthusiasm-problem/‚Äù>aptly stated</a>, all of these candidates, including Biden, can be considered an underdog. None of them has Hillary Clinton‚Äôs obscene advantage in 2016, and all of them are just as equally likely to lose as they are to win. Will Biden win because he simply has the most name recognition and largest number of establishment Democrats interested in his candidacy? Will Warren win because she has the best organization on the ground and most activists interested in her candidacy? Will Sanders prevail because he has the largest donor base and most widespread appeal throughout the country?"," What the Monmouth poll showed was that this race has begun to narrow in scope. That the three main competitors shown in the poll have the highest name recognition out of any of the other candidates should be your main hint to take it as just another data point at this stage in the race, and not a sign of a greater trend. There are three frontrunners, but it‚Äôs anyone else‚Äôs race to lose. We‚Äôve got two debates coming up in September and October and a hectic media push that‚Äôll happen over Christmas and January. All of the top ten candidates that qualified for the September debates will have the staying power to remain in the race until Nevada. As a result, all of them have a pretty decent chance of winning - at least in comparison to the others. ", ,,,,,,,,
9,How Sen. Isakson‚Äôs Retirement Changes the 2020 Senate Race, Georgia was a long shot for Democrats before the announcement. Does a prominent retirement make a difference? , /index.html, Noah Caldwell-Gatsos, mailto:ncaldwellgatsos@gmail.com, @ Noah, 08/28/19, 3:00 PM CST, /projects/elections/images/bp9front.jpeg, Suburban Georgia is going to be the main battleground in this elections, Google Images," Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia has represented the state in the U.S. Senate for nearly fourteen years, and recently won reelection in 2016 against a little known Atlanta investment banker named Jim Barksdale. Not a single prominent Democrat in Georgia volunteered to run against Sen. Isakson then. Their bench has widened significantly coming into 2020, with a few caveats. Stacey Abrams has once again declined to run for Senate, focusing her energy on her anti-voter suppression project coming into the General Elections. This means that no nationwide celebrity is coming to save the 2020 Georgia Senate race, which might actually be a good thing. Unknown candidates have a high ceiling of support relative to those with high name recognition. But they also come with higher volatility. In this post, I want to cover Democrats‚Äô chances of flipping one of the two Senate seats up for grabs in Georgia in 2020, discuss their most likely candidates, and the Republican factor of who gets nominated as Isakson‚Äôs replacement in the meantime. "," The governors of most states have the authority to fill vacant Senate seats with someone from their own party. This reality makes it all the more unfortunate that Stacey Abrams was unable to win the Governor‚Äôs Mansion in 2018. Given the rules of Georgia‚Äôs constitution, she would have been able to nominate anyone she pleased to the Senate, where they would have enjoyed the advantage of incumbency going into the 2020 Special Election. That is mostly conjecture - Isakson likely wouldn‚Äôt have been as willing to retire if he knew that a Democrat would replace him. Now, Republicans get to benefit from Gov. Kemp‚Äôs appointment. Two factors go into a Governor‚Äôs decision in appointing a replacement Senator. The first is their own prospects for reelection. A Governor‚Äôs appointment choice is heavily subject to scrutiny from the party. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey reportedly wanted to nominate John McCain‚Äôs widow Cindy McCain to his Senate seat after he passed away in mid-2018, but feared the backlash from far-right members of his party. He refused to nominate someone more controversial, instead choosing to nominate former Senator John Kyl who had no interest in being reelected in 2020. After Kyl‚Äôs surprise retirement in December, Ducey had the easy choice of appointing the losing 2018 Republican candidate for Senate, Martha McSally, to the seat. Gov. Kemp faces a similar situation: does he nominate an elder statesman who won‚Äôt offend anybody and won‚Äôt run for reelection in 2020, or does he nominate a firebrand who will go on to run again? The first option is safe, but removes the advantage that incumbency brings a Senate candidate. The second option is riskier, but enables whoever the appointee to go on and be a favorite for 2020. This option certainly worked out for Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota, who was appointed to fill the Senate seat of resigning Senator Al Franken, and won her subsequent 2018 reelection. "," I believe Gov. Kemp will choose the latter option. He is a firm Trump-ally and popular among Georgia Republicans, and is not in any kind of difficult or opportunistic electoral position come 2022. He has little reason to go with a safe option. Instead, he will want to have a hand in who might be Georgia‚Äôs Senator for the next ten years (if they win reelection in both 2020 & 2022). There are several past trends to look at when guessing who Kemp might nominate. There have been 11 Senate appointments in the past decade that weren‚Äôt a ‚Äòsafe pick‚Äô: Arizona Senator Martha McSally (lost a concurrent Senate race), Mississippi Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (member of Governor‚Äôs cabinet), Minnesota Senator Tina Smith (member of a governor‚Äôs cabinet), Alabaman Senator Luther Strange (member of a governor‚Äôs cabinet), South Carolinian Senator Tim Scott (Member of SC‚Äôs U.S. House Delegation), Hawaiian Senator Brian Schatz (member of a governor‚Äôs cabinet), Montanan Senator John Walsh (member of a Governor‚Äôs cabinet), Illinois Senator Roland Burris (member of a governor‚Äôs cabinet), New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (Member of NY‚Äôs U.S. House Delegation), Nevada Senator Dean Heller (Member of NV‚Äôs U.S. House Delegation) and Colorado Senator Michael Bennett (unrelated). Six of these eleven were members of a governor‚Äôs cabinet, which brings Kemp‚Äôs own into the spotlight, and they were all under 60 when appointed. ","What does that mean for Georgia? It rules out Agricultural Commissioner Gary Black and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and leaves his Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and his Attorney General Chris Carr. Carr‚Äôs not particularly close with the Governor but had strong ties to Isakson, for whom he served as Chief of Staff. Duncan, despite being close with Kemp, is much like Stacey Abrams and has previously ruled out stints in Washington to the media. If I had to guess, Kemp will nominate Carr. However, Kemp has a habit of going against tradition, and I wonder if he‚Äôll buck the trend and nominate Nick Ayers - a Georgia native and former aide to both Vice President Mike Pence and fmr. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. Ayers refused an offer to become Trump‚Äôs Chief of Staff earlier this year to pursue political office in his home state. Such a move would immediately launch him into consideration of being the 2024 Republican Vice Presidential nominee should he win in 2020 and 2022. Between Carr and Ayers, there are some promising possibilities for Kemp as he continues to govern Georgia. "," Onto the Democrats. Their chances of winning both seats in Georgia are slim. When two seats are up in a single state during an election, they tend to go the same way. What does that mean in 2020? Not all that much actually. Georgia‚Äôs a swing state now, and with Trump‚Äôs approval rating barely above water at +2%, Georgian Democrats need to copy some strategies from other candidates to win one or both of the seats (and hope the Democratic nominee for President‚Äôs really good). Because the other seat has an entrenched incumbent in Sen. David Perdue, I would suggest that the Democrats concentrate most of their resources on this race. A Senator‚Äôs name recognition isn‚Äôt going to go up all that much in a year. They‚Äôll have an incumbency advantage, but it‚Äôll be smaller. Voter elasticity - the number of swing voters in a state - is declining across the country and Georgia‚Äôs no exception. That means they need a candidate who can drive up turnout to win Isakson‚Äôs vacant seat. They don‚Äôt need a moderate, they‚Äôll have those running against Sen. Perdue. Instead, what they need is a Stacey Abrams-like candidate who can drum up voter enthusiasm and benefit the most from Abrams‚Äô drive to combat voter suppression. The best candidate I can think for the Democrats to run in 2020 is Rep. Lucy McBath. The worst candidate I can think of for Democrats to run is Jon Ossoff. Ironically both come from the same congressional district. ",2020, Georgia, Senate, McBath, https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/28/republicans-should-worry-about-senate-lot/?noredirect=on, Republicans should worry about the Senate. A lot., https://www.vox.com/2019/8/28/20836716/johnny-isakson-georgia-retirement-2020-david-perdue-democratic-senate-majority, Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson‚Äôs retirement offers Democrats another opportunity for a Senate pickup, http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-minnesota-twins-a-complete-history-of-double-barrel-senate-elections/, The Minnesota Twins: A Complete History of Double-Barrel Senate Elections," I‚Äôve mentioned in past posts that I really dislike Democratic tendencies to allow opportunistic electoral House losers to compete in Senate races. If they did not win in the small pond, they will not succeed in the big one. This is why I dislike both MJ Hegar and Amy McGrath‚Äôs candidacies in Texas and Kentucky respectively. They both failed to win in their CDs and I‚Äôm sure that Schumer just picked the pair of them because they managed to raise money and will distract McConnell and Cornyn as a result. He doesn‚Äôt expect either of them to win. That‚Äôs why I worry that he‚Äôll choose Ossoff over McBath. Neither has expressed interest in running yet - but they‚Äôre the two second-most famous Democrats in Georgia after Abrams. McBath managed to flip the same congressional district in 2018 that Ossoff failed to two years earlier. I would much rather see her compete for the Senate seat than him.
